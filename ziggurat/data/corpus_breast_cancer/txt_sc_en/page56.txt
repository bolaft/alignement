1. Introduction
Although the concept of the basal-like or __BP__ of breast cancer has been known for some time , it has recently become highly topical following the recognition of this class in the high profile cDNA expression analysis1 and 2 and the high frequency of these tumours developing in BRCA1 gene mutation carriers.3 and 4 However , these studies have not focused on routine identification of the __BP__ nor been of sufficient size to examine its clinical relevance in terms of behaviour and association with other prognostic factors in routine clinical usage .
The potential poor survival associated with the expression of basal cell-type __CKs__ in tumour cells was first reported by Dairkee et al. in 19875 and followed by other studies.2 , 6 , 7 and 8 However , the association between __BP__ and patients outcome showed dissimilar results in the different subgroups of breast cancer .
Previous studies have demonstrated that the expression of basal __CKs__ ( __BP__ ) is an independent marker of poor prognosis in breast cancers as a whole.1 , 9 , 10 and 11 In a previous study , van de Rijn7 examined the expression of CK5 / 6 and/or CK17 in 474 unselected breast carcin__LN__ negative tumours but not in the __LN__ positive group .
Similar results were reported by Potemski et al.11 Contrasting this , Nielsen et al.12 and Malzahn et al.13 showed an association between basal CK expression and survival in the __LN__ positive group , but not in the __LN__ negative group .
In this study , we have examined the clinical significance of the __BP__ , defined in a pragmatic fashion applicable to routine clinical practice , in a much larger and well-characterised series of breast cancers with a long term follow-up .
We aim to identify the prognostic value of __BP__ in the different prognostic categories using current clinical practice principally based on stage and grade , to determine which group ( s ) could benefit the most from __BP__ characterisation in routine practice .
Furthermore , we aim to explore the reasons behind the inconsistency of the previous results regarding association between __BP__ and outcome in different cohorts of patients .
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Patients and tumours
This study was based on a well-characterised series of 1944 primary operable invasive breast carcinoma cases entered into the Nottingham Tenovus Primary Breast Carcinoma Series between 1986 and 1998 .
Patients were under the age of 70 and treated in a conventional uniform manner .
The series has been used previously to study the expression of a wide range of biomarkers.9 and 14 Patient 's clinical history and tumour characteristics including age , menopausal status , tumour type,15 histological grade,16 tumour size , lymph node status , __VI__ ,17 and __VI__ 18 were assessed in a uniform fashion .
Information on local , regional and distant recurrence and survival was maintained on a prospective basis .
The patients were followed up at 3 month intervals initially , followed by 6 monthly and annually .
The median overall survival was 73 months and the median time of event-free survival was 66 months ( range 1 - 206 months ) .
Median follow-up was defined as median follow-up for those patients still alive and disease-free at the latest hospital visit .
The disease-free interval was defined as the interval ( in months ) from the date of the primary surgery to the first loco-regional recurrence or distant metastasis .
The overall survival was the time , in months , from the date of the primary surgery to the time of breast cancer related death .
Hormonal therapy was given to 536 patients ( 35.8% ) , chemotherapy to 261 ( 17.4% ) and radiotherapy to 334 patients ( 22.3% ) .
Breast cancer __TMA__ were prepared and immunohistochemically stained for basal cytokeratins ( CK5 / 6 and CK14 ) and other markers as previously described.9 , 10 , 19 , 20 and 21 Positive and negative controls for each marker were used according to the supplier 's data sheet .
Two cores were evaluated from each tumour and only staining of the invasive malignant cells was considered .
Each core was scored individually and the mean of the two readings was calculated .
Immunohistochemical scoring was performed in a blind fashion .
For the purposes of this study , basal positivity was defined as detection of expression in 10% or more of invasive malignant cells for CK5 / 6 and/or CK14 .
This research was approved by Nottingham Research Ethics Committee 2 under the title of Development of a molecular genetic classification of breast cancer .

2.2. Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 10.0 statistical software .
Cutoff values for the different biomarkers included in this study were chosen before statistical analysis .
Standard cutoffs were used for established prognostic factors and were the same as for previously published patient series.10 All factors were used as dichotomous covariates in the statistical analysis with the exception of age , grade and __NPI__ which were analysed as 4 , 3 and 3 groups , respectively .
Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed by 2 test , Long rank and Cox regression analysis , respectively .
Survival curves were analysed by the method of Kaplan - Meier.22 A p-value <0.05 ( two sided ) was considered significant .
3. Results
After excluding the uninformative __TMA__ cores , 1841 and 1821 tumours were available for CK5 / 6 and CK14 immunohistochemical analyses , respectively .
Of the informative cases ( 1872 ) , 347 cases ( 18.6% ) showed __BP__ .
Of all cases , 348 cases were grade 1 , 626 cases were grade 2 and 898 were grade 3. At the time of the primary diagnosis , 1186 ( 63.4% ) patients had __LN__ negative disease .
Recurrence occurred in 367 cases ( 25.1% ) , distant metastases in 348 cases ( 18.7% ) and 190 ( 10.2% ) patients died from breast cancer .
3.1. Relationship to other prognostic factors and outcome
In this study , we have focused on the importance of __BP__ in the whole series as well as key clinical categories of breast cancer in order to identify the group ( s ) in which __BP__ can provide the relevant prognostic information .
3.2. __BP__ in the whole series
In the whole series , __BP__ was associated with larger primary tumour size , recurrence , development of distant metastasis ( with high frequency of liver , lung and brain metastasis [ >3-fold ] and low bone metastasis ) and shorter survival .
In multivariate analysis with adjustment for other prognostic factors including tumour size , grade , lymph node status and vascular invasion , basal phenotype was an independent predictor of DFI and OS .
Similar results were found in __LN__ positive and __LN__ negative groups ; __VI__ positive and __VI__ negative groups and in pre-menopausal and post-menopausal women .
However , when stratified according to different __NPI__ groups ( good , greater-or-equal , slanted3.4 ; moderate 1 , 3.41 - 4.4 ; moderate 2 , 4.41 - 5.4 ; and poor , >5.4 ) , we found that __BP__ was associated with poor outcome in the moderate 1 group ( LR = 5.9 , p = 0.01 and LR = 21.0 , p<0.001 in case of OS and DFI , respectively ) but not in the other groups .
3.3. __BP__ in the different histologic grades
When we stratified the cases according to histological grades , we found that in grade 3 tumours , which form a large part of the series ( 898 cases , 48% of the whole series ) , the __BP__ was associated with most of the established poor prognostic factors included in this study and with poorer OS and DFI .
No such associations were seen in grade 1 or 2 tumours ( LR = 0.5 , p = 0.32 and LR = 0.97 , p = 0.5 in case of OS and DFI , respectively ) .
We have further examined grade 3 tumours stratified according to __LN__ positivity .
Univariate analyses showed that __BP__ was associated with other poorer prognostic factors and with shorter survival in both __LN__ negative and __LN__ positive subgroups .
In the __LN__ negative subgroup of grade 3 tumours ( 27.4% of the whole series ) , the __BP__ showed the strongest prognostic value ( LR = 8.8 , p = 0.003 and LR = 15.73 , p<0.001 in case of OS and DFI , respectively ) followed only by tumour size ( LR = 9.8 , p = 0.002 and LR = 5.57 , p = 0.02 in case of OS and DFI , respectively ) .
Interestingly , in this subgroup , the following was observed : ( A ) The majority were ER negative ( 54% of the cases ) , HER-2 negative ( 63% ) and EGFR negative ( 76% ) . ( B ) Other known prognostic biomarkers such as patients age , __VI__ , menopausal , status , ER , PgR , HER-2 , EGFR , p53 , E-cadherin , P-cadherin , BRCA1 , FHIT protein , BCl-2 , MUC-1 and neuroendocrine markers were not associated with OS or DFI ( the association between combined __BP__ and ER expression and patient outcome in the whole series compared to the __LN__ negative subgroup of grade 3 tumours is shown in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 ) .
However , in the __LN__ positive subgroup , although __BP__ was associated with other established poor prognostic factors and patients outcome , other variables including size , ER , p53 and P-cadherin showed stronger association with survival .
In addition , we examined low grade tumours that showed __BP__ ( 43 cases ; 12% of __BP__ tumours ) and compared them with grade 1 tumours that did not show __BP__ ( 295 cases ) and we noticed the following findings : higher percentage of __BP__ tumours were of metaplastic type ( 12% compared to 0.3% of non-BP grade 1 tumours ) and mucinous carcinomas ( 14% compared to 5% in non-BP ) , while lower percentage were of pure tubular carcinomas ( 7% compared to 22% ) .
The majority of grade 1 __BP__ tumours showed moderate degree of tubule formation ( 82% compared to 64% in non-BP ) and mitotic activity ( 10% compared to 2.2% ) .
Higher percentage of __BP__ tumours were ER and PR negative ( 27% and 33% compared to 7% and 18% in non-BP grade 1 tumours in case of ER and PR , respectively ) .
Regarding adjuvant therapy ( chemotherapy , hormone therapy or radiotherapy ) , when we stratified our series into treatment groups , we found that basal tumours responded better to chemotherapy ( less patients have relapsed and less have died during the 206 months of follow-up ) than the __LN__ , grade and size matched non-basal tumours in certain groups but not in others .
For example , in __LN__ positive grade 3 tumours with primary size <2 cm ( 120 patients ) , there was no statistical difference between patients who received chemotherapy or not in the non-basal group ( LR = 0.11 , p = 0.74 and LR = 1.21 , p = 0.271 in case of OS and DFI , respectively ) , while in the basal group , patients who received chemotherapy showed better outcome ( LR = 7.49 , p = 0.0062 and LR = 13.65 , p = 0.0002 in case of OS and DFI , respectively ) .
__MVA__ including other established prognostic factors ( histologic grade , __LN__ status , primary tumour size , menopausal status , patients age , ER , HER2 , chemotherapy , radiotherapy and hormonal therapy ) showed that __BP__ is an independent predictor of survival in the whole series .
Similar results were obtained in __LN__ negative group ( after excluding __LN__ as a covariate in the analysis ) .
In the __LN__ positive subgroup , __MVA__ including grade , size age and HER2 , showed that __BP__ was an independent predictor of survival ; however , in this subgroup , when ER or menopausal status was included , __BP__ became non-significant .
Regarding tumour grade , __BP__ is an independent predictor of survival in grade 3 tumours but not in grade 1 or 2. __MVA__ with adjustment for prognostic factors including __LN__ status , size , __VI__ , menopausal status , age , ER , HER-2 , EGFR and p53 showed that __BP__ was the only significant variable in predicting regional recurrence in grade 3 tumours .
Furthermore , in __LN__ negative grade 3 tumours , __BP__ was an independent predictor of survival and followed only by tumour size while other factors were not .
These results demonstrate that __BP__ is the most significant prognostic factor in this important group of breast cancers .
4. Discussion
Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease with a range of histological types and grades exhibiting different behavioural outcomes and different patterns of genetic derangement .
Although its incidence is still high , the overall mortality due to breast cancer has decreased , attributed in part to the early application of various treatment modalities.23 In order to reduce the mortality from breast cancer further , there is a desire to examine and characterise tumours , which are of poor prognosis , to predict their biology , ensure adequate therapy and improve patients outcome .
There is also a desire to identify those classes of breast cancer which benefit from targeted biological therapies such as hormone or trastuzumab ( Herceptin ) therapy .
There is also a need to develop additional forms of systemic treatment effective in those tumours failing to express known targets such as ER or HER-2 .
Currently , routine clinical management of breast cancer relies on traditional prognostic factors including nodal status , tumour histological grade , primary tumour size that can be combined into the __NPI__ , in addition to __VI__ , ER and HER-2.24 and 25 Although these prognostic factors are useful , the clinical course of a patient with breast carcinoma remains difficult to predict as tumours of apparently homogeneous morphological characters still vary in response to therapy and have divergent outcomes.26 Therefore , additional molecular markers are being sought to further refine classification , especially in patient subgroups whose outcome cannot be predicted accurately using conventional parameters .
Although previous studies have demonstrated several proteins which are useful in predicting outcome and the tumours which respond to specific therapies , in multivariate analyses , most of these markers co-vary and are therefore not independently informative .
Moreover , they can only provide an additional prognostic value in certain subgroups of breast cancer.27 , 28 , 29 , 30 and 31 For these reasons , the prognostic value of many biomarkers in breast cancer shows a wide range of variations depending on patient cohorts included in each study .
In the current study , we have investigated the clinical relevance of the __BP__ in breast cancer .
Our results demonstrated that the __BP__ shows an association with the other established markers of poor prognosis and with poor patient outcome in our whole series .
However , when we stratified the tumours into different grades , an association with poor outcome was seen in grade 3 tumours only .
This can be explained by the following factors : ( 1 ) the majority of __BP__ tumours are grade 3 ( 248 cases ; 72% of __BP__ ) that have a worse prognosis compared with lower frequency in grades 1 and 2 that generally have a better outcome .
__BP__ is also associated with specific types of tumours such as salivary type tumours with known indolent behaviour.32 and ( 2 ) multivariate analyses showed that the prognostic effect of __BP__ is independent of grade .
In addition , the presence of this inverse association with survival in grade 3 tumours , but not in grade 1 or 2 , might also be related to the difference in the genetic abnormalities that characterise different grades of breast cancers.33 and 34 Thus , __BP__ is likely to be the outcome of molecular genetic alterations arising during the development of a more aggressive subgroup of grade 3 tumours .
Specifically , __BP__ defines a distinct class of grade 3 tumours which originate either from cells with a stem / progenitor cell features , which are known to express these basal markers,35 and 36 or through acquisition of these characteristics during early neoplastic transformation , or less likely that these basal markers may be expressed later during the evolution of a subgroup of grade 3 that acquire aggressive , dedifferentiated features ( reviewed in 37 and 38 ) .
This latter explanation may be supported by observations that grade 3 tumours are characterised by a high degree of genetic instability and a wide range of genetic alterations which may virtually affect any regions of the genome.34 Also of importance is the fact that __BP__ morphology and phenotype are found at significantly higher frequency in tumours developing in patients with BRCA1 germline mutations.3 , 4 and 39
Our results are consistent with previous studies that reported an association between the expression of basal cell markers and shorter OS and DFS in the whole series7 and 11 and in __LN__ negative7 , 11 and 13 or positive tumours.12 and 13 Our results are also in agreement with Malzahn et al.13 who examined basal __CKs__ profile and demonstrated an association with shorter survival in a subgroup of grade 3 tumours but not in other groups .
We also found that in a large subgroup that comprised __LN__ negative , grade 3 tumours ( 27% of the whole series ) , __BP__ was significantly associated with poor patients outcome while other known prognostic markers including __NPI__ , __VI__ , tumour type , menopausal status and ER expression did not .
Importantly , the majority of tumours in this subgroup was characterised by ER , HER-2 and EGFR negativity and therefore , lacks the benefit of specific therapy that targets these biomarkers .
In addition , they were highly proliferative and may benefit from conventional chemotherapy .
It is also known that grade 3 tumours are more responsive to chemotherapy than other grades.40 These results may have a major impact on the management of a certain group of patients with breast cancer .
Further study and characterisation of these tumours may have a potential to identify new targets for new agent treatments in this group .
In the current study , we also found that there is a trend for tumours with __BP__ to have a more favourable outcome following the use of adjuvant ; chemotherapy , however , because of the limited number of patients located within each comparable group and lack of randomisation to treatment this observation needs further study in a more appropriate or clinical trial setting to confirm these preliminary results .
In conclusion , our study provides robust data that __BP__ can provide additional prognostic information on breast cancer and particularly in a selected subgroup that comprises __LN__ negative , grade 3 tumours in which it provides prognostic information stronger than any other well established marker and can identify a specific subgroup of patients that may benefit from a more aggressive approach to adjuvant therapy .
We therefore recommend routine staining of breast cancer with basal __CKs__ , particularly in grade 3 tumours .
