As the incidence of breast cancer has progressively increased , survival rates have simultaneously improved , owing to improvements in early detection and adjuvant chemotherapy .
Young women with breast cancer are considered high risk , and are likely to receive chemotherapy , as the magnitude of benefit seems to be enhanced .
As a result , these women are likely to suffer ovarian damage from chemotherapy , which can have a profound effect on their quality of life .
At present , it is impossible to predict the lifespan of the chemotherapeutically damaged ovary .
Ovarian reserve testing has become established in the fertility setting where it is used to predict outcome in assisted reproduction .
These tests have the potential to estimate the reproductive lifespan of the ovaries , which would allow an accurate estimation of fertility status and the risk of premature ovarian failure .
There is a need for such tests to be validated in patients with breast cancer , so that the information needs of these patients can be met , and appropriate measures taken to improve their fecundity and overall quality of life .
The aim of this study was to evaluate ovarian function in young women treated by multi-agent , cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy for breast cancer by using clinical , biochemical and biophysical parameters .
This was based on the hypothesis that cytotoxic drugs used to treat premenopausal patients with breast cancer can cause ovarian damage resulting in diminished ovarian reserve .
PATIENTS AND METHODS
In this pilot study , pre-menopausal recipients of chemotherapy for breast cancer were analysed in two groups - a longitudinal arm ( group 1 ) and a cross-sectional arm ( group 2 ) .
As all patients were recruited from a single centre , the chemotherapy regimens employed were standardised .
There were two predominant regimens , both cyclophosphamide-based .
The first was E-CMF , which consisted of four cycles of epirubicin ( E ) , followed by four cycles of Cyclophosphamide ( C ) , methotrexate ( M ) and 5 fluorouracil ( F ) .
The second was FEC , which consisted of six cycles of 5 fluorouracil , epirubicin and cyclophosphamide .
Some patients received taxanes ( docetaxel or paclitaxel ) , usually as part of a therapeutic trial ( TANGO ) .
The cumulative dosages received by patients in the longitudinal analysis are displayed in Table 1.
In group 1 , patients were offered ovarian reserve testing before receiving chemotherapy .
The same patients were then followed up longitudinally by performing further testing immediately following chemotherapy .
In group 2 , patients were tested for ovarian reserve before chemotherapy ( some patients were also part of the longitudinal study ) and after chemotherapy ( once regular menstrual cycles had resumed ) .
Patients with oestrogen-sensitive cancer were recruited provided they had not taken tamoxifen or gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogue ( GnRHa ) ( goserelin or leuprolin ) for at least the preceding 12 weeks .
Controls were age matched , had no medical illness , had proven fertility ( defined by virtue of having at least one childbirth previously ) and had a normal menstrual history .
Those on oral contraception were asked to discontinue it and use alternative ( barrier ) contraception for at least 8 weeks before testing .
Informed consent was obtained from all participants .
This study received ethical approval from the Joint UCL / UCLH Ethics Committee .
Biochemical tests
Biochemical tests included __FSH__ __FSH__ .
Blood samples ( 15 ml ) were obtained from all subjects during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle ( day 2-5 ) .
Four-timed samples were performed , 15 min apart ( to account for the pulsatile variation of __FSH__ release ) .
Following the last-timed sample , the gonadotrophin analogue stimulation test ( G-test ) was commenced .
This involved administering a GnRHa - Buserelin 1 mg subcutaneously .
This route was chosen to ensure compliance in preference to intranasal administration , which would have involved four divided doses over 24 h .
Administration of the G-test was intended to produce a transient ovarian stimulation .
This response is quantified after performing a single repeat blood sample approximately 24 h later .
Serum was separated and stored at -20°C before hormone measurements .
Assaying each of the four samples and determining an average value then determined mean serum concentrations for __FSH__ , __LH__ and E2 .
For the inhibins and __AMH__ , pooled samples were obtained from the four-timed samples before assaying ( obtained by mixing equivalent volumes from each timed sample before freezing ) .
Assays : Follicle-stimulating hormone and __LH__ : all samples were assayed in duplicate using a commercial Coat a count solid phase Immunoradiometric assay ( DPC , Gwynedd , UK ) .
The sensitivity of the assay is 0.06 mIU ml-1 and the intra- and interassay variation was <7% .
Oestradiol : All samples were assayed in duplicate using a commercial ELISA kit ( IBL Immunobiological Laboratories , Hamburg , Germany ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
The sensitivity of the assay was 4.6 pg ml-1 and the intra- and interassay variation was <6% .
Inhibin A : Serum concentrations of dimeric inhibin A were measured in duplicate 50 mul aliquots as described previously .
The sensitivity of the assay was 2 pg ml-1 and the intra- and interassay variations were <6% .
Inhibin B : All samples were assayed in duplicate using a commercial ELISA kit ( Oxford bio innovations-DSL , Oxford , UK ) according to the manufacturer 's protocol .
The sensitivity of the assay is 10 pg ml-1 .
The intra- and interassay variations were <10% .
Activin A : This was measured using a two-site ELISA specific for total activin A as described previously .
The detection limit of this assay for human recombinant activin A ( Genentech INC , San Francisco , CA , USA ) was 50 pg ml-1 .
Intra- and interassay variations were 8.5 and 9.8% , respectively .
Antimullerian hormone : All samples were assayed in duplicate using a commercial assay kit according to the manufacturer 's sensitised assay protocol ( Immunotech , Marseille , France ) .
The sensitivity of the assay was 0.098 ng ml-1 .
The intra- and interassay variations were <15% using an in-house quality control pool .
Biophysical tests
Ultrasound examination was performed on the same day that blood samples were taken ( before ovarian stimulation ) .
Inter-observer variability was minimised by having all ultrasound scans performed by a single investigator ( AP ) .
Additional support for performing scans was provided specifically by another investigator ( BP ) if required .
An Acuson 128 XP4 ( Acuson USA ) with a 2.5-4 mHz-vector probe ( transabdominal ) and a 5-7.5 mHz EC-7 ( transvaginal ) probe were used to perform the scans .
Ultrasound parameters
Antral follicle count : Round- or oval-shaped echo-free structures from 2 to 10 mm within the ovaries were considered to be follicles .
Total __AFC__ was the sum of antral follicles measured from both ovaries .
Ovarian volume : Ovarian volume was calculated for each ovary using the prolate ellipsoid formula :
Mean pulsatility index and mean peak systolic velocity : Ovarian stromal blood flow velocity waveforms were obtained by placing the Doppler gate over the ovarian stroma , which had the highest achievable signals , ensuring that no arteries near the surface of the ovary were measured .
Peak systolic velocity and pulsatility indices from both ovaries were then combined to provide the mean pulsatility index and mean peak systolic velocity , respectively .
Uterus : Uterine cross-sectional area ( cm2 ) and endometrial thickness ( mm ) were calculated by examining the uterus in the sagittal plane .
Statistical analyses
A normality test was carried out to assess the distribution of data .
Most variables in the cross-sectional data analysis had a gaussian distribution .
As such , unpaired Student 's t-tests were carried out to compare biochemical and biophysical parameters between patients and controls .
One-way analysis of variance used to compare baseline parameters only .
A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant .
When a significant difference was found , a post hoc test ( Bonferroni 's multiple comparisons ) was used to compare differences between individual groups .
For non-gaussian distribution , the Mann-Whitney test was employed .
Data in the longitudinal group , which had a normal distribution , were analysed using the paired t-test .
Non-parametric variables were analysed using the Wilcoxon-signed rank test .
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism version 3.00 for Windows ( GraphPad Software , San Diego CA , USA ) and Statistical Package for Social Sciences ( SPSS Inc. , Chicago , IL , USA ) .
RESULTS
All tests performed were well tolerated , with no adverse effects reported .
Results are presented as mean values along with the standard error of the mean ( s.e.m. ) .
Cross-sectional data
Clinical parameters : There was no statistically significant difference ( P>0. 05 ) in age among all the three groups .
The mean age for patients in the pre-chemotherapy group was 35.2±1.5 , for patients in the post-chemotherapy group 36.7±0.6 and in the controls 34.5±0.9 .
Similarly , there was no statistically significant difference in __BMI__ ( kg m-2 ) among the three groups .
The mean __BMI__ for patients in the pre-chemotherapy group was 24.27±0.84 , for patients in the post-chemotherapy group 24.59±0.53 and in the controls 26.04±1.02 .
Biochemical parameters : All biochemical tests included basal ( b ) estimates as well as stimulated and delta ( stimulated - baseline , Delta ) results following administration of the G-test .
There were no significant differences in biochemical parameters between patients in the pre-chemotherapy arm and the controls .
In the post-chemotherapy arm , there were significant differences when compared to the controls for basal __FSH__ ( 11.32±1.48 vs 6.62±0.42 mIU ml-1 , P<0.001 ) , basal __AMH__ ( 0.95±0.34 vs 7.89±1.62 ng ml-1 , P<0.001 ) and basal inhibin B ( 19.24±4.56 vs 83.61±13.45 pg ml-1 , P<0.001 ) .
One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences in the mean values for all three groups ( pre-chemotherapy , post-chemotherapy and controls ) for basal __FSH__ , basal __AMH__ and basal inhibin B ( P<0.001 ) .
Basal E2 was significantly lower in the control group compared with patients in the pre-chemotherapy group ( 144.7±26.13 vs 252.0± 49.1 pg ml-1 ) .
Following administration of the G-test , there were significant differences between patients in the post-chemotherapy arm and the controls for stimulated __FSH__ ( but not Ä __FSH__ ) ( 22.69± 1.77 vs 17.5±1.37 mIU ml-1 , P<0.05 ) ; stimulated and delta E2 ( 208.9±37.5 vs 427.9±55.87 pg ml-1 ( stimulated ) , P<0.01 ; 107.8±23.9 vs 283.2±40.34 pg ml-1 ( delta ) , P< 0.01 ) and finally stimulated and delta inhibin B ( 22.5±6.04 vs 180.4±22.8 pg ml-1 ( stimulated ) , P<0.001 ; 3.02±2.3 vs 96.82±16.38 pg ml-1 ( delta ) , P<0.001 ) .
One-way ANOVA revealed significant differences overall among the three groups ( pre-chemotherapy , post-chemotherapy and controls ) for stimulated __FSH__ ( P<0.01 ) , stimulated and delta E2 ( P<0.01 ) and stimulated and delta inhibin B ( P<0.001 ) ( Figure 1B and C ) .
Biophysical parameters : There were no significant differences in biophysical parameters between patients in the pre-chemotherapy arm and the controls .
In the post-chemotherapy arm , total ( and mean ) __AFC__ was the only biophysical parameter that displayed a significant difference between patients in the post-chemotherapy arm and the controls ( TAFC 7.8±0.9 vs 17.1±1.2 , P<0.001 ; MAFC 4.4±0.5 vs 8.5±0.6 , P<0.001 ) .
One-way ANOVA showed a highly significant difference in the mean TAFC among the three groups ( P<0.0001 ) . .
Longitudinal data
In this data set , patients were tested during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle preceding chemotherapy and immediately following completion of chemotherapy .
It is important to note that patients tested immediately post-chemotherapy were universally amenorrhoeic , and as such were not offered the G-test .
All parameters were tested for normality and most were found to have a gaussian distribution .
Significant findings in this group are displayed in Figure 2.
Biochemical parameters : Basal __FSH__ was significantly lower in patients pre-chemotherapy compared with post-chemotherapy levels ( 7.9±1.4 vs 46.7±10.8 mIU ml-1 , P<0.01 ) .
In addition , basal __AMH__ and basal inhibin B levels were much higher in patients tested pre-chemotherapy compared with post-chemotherapy , but these results were not statistically significant ( 4.4±1.1 vs 0.07±0.02 , P>0.05 ( __AMH__ , ng ml-1 ) ; 62.5±29.8 vs 6.0±0.6 , P>0.05 ( inhibin B , pg ml-1 ) ) .
Biophysical parameters : Both total and mean AFCs were significantly higher in patients tested pre-chemotherapy compared with post-chemotherapy ( 15.0±2.7 vs 5.1±0.7 , P<0.01 ( TAFC ) ; 7.5±1.3 vs 2.7±0.3 , P<0.01 ( MAFC ) .
There were no other statistically significant differences between the pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy biophysical markers , including total and mean __OV__ ( 11.1±0.9 vs 8.4±1.6 , P>0.05 ( TOV , ml ) ; 5.6±0.5 vs 4.3±0.7 , P>0.05 ( MOV , ml ) .
Correlations
Correlation statistics were performed using SPSS comparing each of the ovarian reserve markers within each of the three groups studied : controls , pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy patients , respectively .
Bivariate analysis was performed using Pearson 's correlation coefficients .
Significant correlations were flagged at the 0.01 level ( two-tailed ) or the 0.05 level ( two-tailed ) .
Antimüllerian hormone as a basal marker correlated with DeltaE2 in patients and the controls ( r=0.759 , P<0.001 and r=0.518 , P<0.05 , respectively ) , as well as basal inhibin B ( r=0.842 , P<0.001 ) .
Furthermore , __AMH__ was the only parameter ( in addition to bFSH ) to correlate with chronological age in patients only ( r=0.78 , P<0.05 ) .
Delta Inhibin B correlated best with biophysical markers of ovarian reserve .
In controls , inhibin B correlated positively with TAFC and MAFC ( r=0.494 , P<0.05 ; r=0.509 , P<0.05 ) , whereas Delta E2 correlated positively with TAFC in the pre-chemotherapy group , but not the controls ( r=0.670 , P<0.05 ) .
Overall , basal markers , which appeared to correlate the most with other markers , were __AMH__ and inhibin B. Post-stimulation , however , E2 and inhibin B were the only markers to correlate with __AFC__ .
No correlations with __OV__ were identified .
DISCUSSION
The results of this study show that biochemical and biophysical tests may be used to accurately estimate ovarian reserve in premenopausal recipients of chemotherapy for breast cancer .
This study confirms the observation of a recent paper where the new ovarian reserve tests , such as inhibin B , __AMH__ and __AFC__ , were investigated in breast cancer patients before and after treatment .
However , our study is the first in which dynamic ovarian reserve testing ( G-test ) has been evaluated in breast cancer patients .
In an IVF setting , basal ovarian markers can be normal yet these patients do not respond to stimulation .
Hence , dynamic tests are used in the assisted reproductive technology setting as they give a better indication of the ovarian response to stimulation .
We believe the G-test can add to the discriminatory capacity provided by basal markers alone , as the underlying pathophysiology of chemotherapy-mediated gonadotoxicity is in fact dynamic .
In the recently published study , __AMH__ concentration in particular was found to be useful as an early indicator of ovarian ageing , including the assessment of chemotherapy-induced ovarian follicle loss .
Contrary to this study where the patients were 28-52 years of age , our study cohort comprised a significantly younger patient cohort ( mean age of patients was 41.3 in the chemotherapy arm of the Anderson study , compared with 35.2 and 36.7 in the pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy arms of our study ) , and included an age-matched control group with proven fertility .
This was in keeping with our objective , which was to evaluate ORT in young women with breast cancer .
It is this group where validation of ORT could potentially lead to adequate counselling and treatment with regards fertility preservation , at a time when therapeutic intervention is still feasible .
Previous studies in breast cancer were focused mainly on the incidence of amenorrhoea and premature menopause .
Other investigators assessed the endocrine consequences of chemotherapy in patients with breast cancer , but the analysis was limited to gonadotrophin and steroid alterations .
These studies were performed long before the concept of ovarian reserve was realised .
The importance of these alterations were accurately surmised as being detrimental to fertility , but the limitations of these studies prevented meaningful application in clinical practice .
Prospective studies are limited and have been performed in women and men with haematological malignancy .
Our data suggest that ovarian reserve was intact before chemotherapy in a breast cancer cohort , implying that multi-agent chemotherapy was the main factor that led to diminished ovarian reserve .
Alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide , which are non cell-cycle specific , are more toxic to the ovaries than cell-cycle-specific agents , such as methotrexate and fluorouracil .
It is unclear , however , what effect multi-agent chemotherapy has on ovarian reserve , especially , given the fact that newer agents are continually being developed .
All the biochemical and biophysical markers with the exception of basal oestradiol ( bE2 ) levels provided evidence that ovarian reserve was intact before chemotherapy .
The G-test is a dynamic ovarian reserve test .
It was chosen in this study , as it provided an ovarian response , which was less potent than the HMG test , an important factor to consider in patients with breast cancer .
Although bE2 levels were significantly higher in patients ( pre-chemotherapy ) compared with the controls , there was no significant difference between stimulated and delta E2 levels .
This may be explained by the fact that bE2 levels correlate more with the underlying disease , as it has been shown that high plasma E2 concentrations have been linked to breast cancer development regardless of menopausal status .
Oestradiol increase in response to the G-test , however , probably correlates better with ovarian reserve , which would explain the lack of a significant difference in patients compared with the controls in addition to the other markers of ovarian reserve .
Perhaps , the main factor involved in assessing these patients appropriately is the fact that the pathophysiological process is dynamic , with both acute and cumulative effects .
As such , efforts to grade the extent of ovarian damage , and indeed ovarian recovery by clinical , biochemical and biophysical parameters are limited by the dynamic processes involved .
Furthermore , extrapolation of data from one cancer cohort to another is inappropriate due to differences in disease , type of chemotherapy and the demographics of the population studied .
In the fertility setting , the most important aspect of diminished ovarian reserve and the associated decline in reproductive potential is that its onset is highly variable .
To the best of our knowledge , it appears that no single marker can be clinically useful in assessing ovarian reserve , leading to the evaluation of multiple markers ( Lutchman Singh et al , 2005 ) .
Our study group comprised regularly cycling patients and controls .
Although all patients had undergone a variable period of amenorrhoea following chemotherapy , clinical characteristics alone ( patient age , __BMI__ and parity ) were not found to be discriminatory once cyclical activity resumed .
This is in keeping with the generally accepted notion that clinical characteristics are not reliable estimates of reproductive age .
Biochemical parameters , which appeared to discriminate between patients and the controls in the cross-sectional data set , were serum __FSH__ , E2 , inhibin B and __AMH__ .
The data relating to the use of __FSH__ in estimating ovarian reserve in breast cancer are limited .
Although widely used in a reproductive medicine setting , its main limitations arise from a lack of reproducibility .
The pulsatile nature of __FSH__ secretion is believed to be one of the factors responsible for this variation .
To minimise this possibility , we took four ( 4 ) -timed samples , 15 min apart and used a mean value as a true representative figure. Basal __FSH__ levels were significantly different across the three groups ( controls , pre-chemotherapy and post-chemotherapy patients , P=0.0006 ) .
Following the G-test , stimulated __FSH__ levels were also significantly different ( P=0.01 ) .
However , DeltaFSH levels did not confer any discriminatory capacity .
Follicle-stimulating hormone is an indirect marker of ovarian reserve and depends on the presence of an intact __HPO__ axis .
Administration of the G-test causes a temporary increase in pituitary secretion of __FSH__ and __LH__ , to which the ovaries respond by releasing E2 .
It is the amount of E2 released ( Delta ) , which correlates with ovarian reserve , not DeltaFSH , which is in keeping with the results .
Basal oestradiol levels were significantly higher in the pre-chemotherapy group compared with the controls .
This may have a role in the pathophysiological process of breast cancer as described earlier .
No significant difference existed between the controls and the post-chemotherapy group .
In fact , higher levels of bE2 were seen in the pre-chemotherapy group as opposed to the post-chemotherapy , which one would not expect , as higher levels of E2 are associated with diminished ovarian reserve .
Both stimulated and delta E2 levels were significantly different , however , being much lower in the post-chemotherapy group compared with the pre-chemotherapy group and the controls , respectively .
This supports the notion that the G-test confers discriminatory capacity .
Basal , stimulated and Delta inhibin B levels were all significantly different between patients and the controls .
Although inhibin B is mainly secreted by pre-antral follicles , inhibin A is produced primarily during the late follicular phase by mature follicles and the corpus luteum .
This would explain why the former is a more reliable marker of ovarian reserve , as our results confirm .
The added discriminatory capacity as provided by the G-test for inhibin B and E2 is consistent with the theory that the pathophysiological processes taking place within the ovary are in fact dynamic - thus necessitating a dynamic form of assessment .
Antimullerian hormone is considered a direct marker of ovarian reserve , as it is produced by FSH-sensitive early antral follicles .
In this way , it may be a more sensitive predictor of ovarian reserve than other markers , such as __AFC__ and inhibin B , which detect more mature primordial follicles .
Antimullerian hormone has a relatively stable expression over the menstrual cycle ( Cook et al , 2000 ; La Marca et al , 2006 ) .
This would explain why serum __AMH__ levels were mostly unchanged in our study following the G-test , a phenomenon detected in other studies .
Our results confirm that basal __AMH__ levels were dramatically reduced in the post-chemotherapy group compared with both the controls and the pre-chemotherapy group .
With regard to biophysical parameters , our data suggest that __AFC__ is most useful .
Although studies in cancer are limited , __AFC__ and __OV__ have been found to be useful in assessing ovarian reserve in childhood survivors of cancer and patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation .
Our results did not show a significant difference in __OV__ between patients and the controls , although it was approaching significance ( P=0.06 ) .
Longitudinal data analysis revealed that the parameters , which were discriminatory between these two groups , were __FSH__ , E2 and __AFC__ .
It can be deduced that the multi-agent chemotherapy received by these patients suppressed ovarian function resulting in a hypoestrogenic state , with a corresponding high __FSH__ and amenorrhoea .
Reduced __AFC__ reflects a reduction in the number of antral follicles and is consistent with our observation in the cross-sectional population ( post-chemotherapy cycling women ) .
Ovarian volume , as was the case in the cross-sectional data , was not significantly different between both groups .
This may be a reflection of the fact that the induced hypoestrogenic state was temporary .
It can be argued that in terms of reproductive ageing , a reduction in __OV__ is a relatively late event that comes about after a protracted period of diminished ovarian reserve .
It is plausible that despite these patients being amenorrhoeic , the unchanged OVs implied that resumption of ovarian function , albeit at a level lower than the pre-chemotherapy state , was likely to occur .
In fact , all patients in the post-chemotherapy arm of the cross-sectional analysis had resumed normal menses , indicating that the effects of the multi-agent chemotherapy received were at least partially reversible .
In summary , this study confirms the use of biochemical and biophysical parameters of ovarian reserve in a breast cancer cohort .
The methodology was robust and included elaborate methods of testing - all of which appeared to be well tolerated .
The cohort was disease standardised and received cyclophosphamide-based chemotherapy .
Biochemical markers , which appeared to be discriminatory , included __FSH__ , __AMH__ , inhibin B and E2 in response to the G-test .
The only clearly discriminatory biophysical marker was the __AFC__ .
There was good correlation between __AFC__ and other markers of ovarian reserve .
These results taken together support the hypothesis that ovarian reserve is reduced in young , regularly cycling women following treatment with chemotherapeutic agents for breast cancer .
The data also add to the understanding of the pathophysiological processes involved .
These findings have major implications for breast cancer survivors , for whom reproductive issues are a major concern .
Furthermore , the potential exists for ovarian reserve testing to be applied in patients with different types of cancer .
To achieve this , a large sample size should be followed up longitudinally to determine the potential therapeutic role of ovarian reserve testing in this cohort .
In conclusion , this study confirms that ovarian reserve can be assessed in breast cancer patients using __AFC__ , inhibin B and __AMH__ to inform patients on their prospects of fertility treatment post chemotherapy .
