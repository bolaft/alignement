Ataxia-telangiectasia
Ataxia-telangiectasia ( MIM 208900 ) is an autosomal recessive condition with an estimated frequency of 1 in 40000 to 1 in 300000 in Caucasian populations .
It is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia , oculomotor apraxia , frequent infections , choreoathetosis , telangiectasias of the conjunctivae , immunodeficiency , sensitivity to ionizing radiation and an increased risk of malignancy .
Individuals with ataxia-telangiectasia are estimated to have a 100 fold increased risk of cancer compared with the general population .
Lymphoid cancers predominate in childhood , and epithelial cancers , including breast cancer , are seen in adults .
The gene for ataxia-telangiectasia was mapped to chromosome 11q by genetic linkage analysis in 1988 and was identified by positional cloning in 1995 .
The gene was called __ATM__ .
Although the condition was initially thought to be genetically heterogeneous and had been delineated into four complementation groups , __ATM__ mutation analysis revealed that all groups were due to mutations in the same gene .
The majority of ataxia-telangiectasia patients are compound heterozygotes or homozygotes for identifiable __ATM__ mutations that have been inherited from each parent .
The prevalence of such __ATM__ mutations has been shown to be 0.5 - 1% in Western populations .
Over 300 distinct mutations have been reported ( see ) of which >80% are base substitutions or insertions / deletions that generate premature termination codons or splicing abnormalities .
The truncated species is usually unstable and results in absent or severely reduced protein expression .
Certain missense mutations can also cause ataxia-telangiectasia , but only account for approximately 10% of __ATM__ mutations identified in ataxia-telangiectasia patients .
Base substitutions in __ATM__ are common and it can , therefore , be difficult to deduce whether a specific missense mutation is causative of ataxia-telangiectasia , particularly if protein expression is not abnormal .
__ATM__ structure and function
The __ATM__ gene is located at 11q22.3 and consists of 66 exons , 62 of which encode a protein of 3056 amino acids .
__ATM__ belongs to a protein family known as the __PIKK__ .
These proteins are characterized by a domain similar to that in phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase and most PIKKs , including __ATM__ , are active serine / threonine kinases .
__ATM__ also contains a C-terminal FAT domain ( FRAP , __ATM__ , TRAPP ) , with a highly conserved 35 residue tail known as the FATC domain .
This domain appears to be important for regulating the kinase activity of __ATM__ and for binding regulatory proteins .
The N-terminus of __ATM__ includes several HEAT domains that may influence interactions with other proteins and a region essential for substrate binding .
Other putative motifs , including an incomplete leucine zipper and a proline-rich region that binds c-Abl , have been reported , but are less well characterized .
__ATM__ has multiple complex functions including a central role in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks .
The response to DNA damage includes numerous processes including recognition of damaged DNA , recruitment of repair proteins , signalling to cell cycle checkpoints , transcriptional regulation and activation of apoptosis .
__ATM__ is involved in many of these processes .
In normal cells __ATM__ exists as inert dimers or multimers .
In response to double-strand DNA breaks __ATM__ dissociates to highly active monomers .
During this process , __ATM__ undergoes autophosphorylation on Ser1981 and is recruited to sites of DNA damage where it initiates a signalling cascade through phosphorylation of multiple DNA damage response and cell-cycle proteins , including proteins encoded by breast cancer susceptibility genes such as TP53 , BRCA1 and CHEK2 .
Full exposition of the functions of __ATM__ is beyond the scope of this article and the reader is referred to recent reviews .
Epidemiological evidence for breast cancer risk in __ATM__ heterozygotes
Swift first proposed that relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia might be at increased risk of breast cancer nearly twenty years ago .
His analysis of cancer incidence in 110 ataxia-telangiectasia families suggested that the relative risk of cancer was 2.3 for men and 3.1 for women , with breast cancer being the most strongly associated cancer .
This observation was clearly of importance to ataxia-telangiectasia families , but also had potential wider significance given that it was estimated that up to 1% of the population might be carriers of an ataxia-telangiectasia predisposing mutation .
Thus , even a relatively modest increase in breast cancer risk in carriers could equate to an appreciable population attributable risk .
Subsequent to Swift 's initial report , several epidemiological surveys of cancer incidence in relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia cases were conducted and confirmed the increased risk of breast cancer .
A review of four of these studies estimated the breast cancer relative risk to be 3.9 .
Recently , a large study of 1160 relatives of 169 ataxia-telangiectasia patients was published .
This comprehensive analysis estimated the overall relative risk of breast cancer in carriers to be 2.23 ( 95% CI=1.16 - 4.28 ) compared to the general population and was higher in women under 50 years of age at 4.9 ( 95% CI=1.90 - 12.9 ) .
Molecular evidence for breast cancer risk in __ATM__ heterozygotes
A key prediction of the observation that relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia cases are at increased risk of breast cancer is that __ATM__ mutations should occur at increased frequency in breast cancer cases compared with controls .
However , the first analysis of 401 breast cancer cases and 201 controls for __ATM__ mutations did not support this .
A variety of reasons were suggested to explain the apparent contradiction between the epidemiological studies and this initial case - control comparison of __ATM__ in breast cancer .
The model put forward by Gatti_et_al. has been most widely embraced and proposed that the __ATM__ mutations that confer susceptibility to breast cancer differ from those that occur in ataxia-telangiectasia .
Specifically , they proposed that missense __ATM__ variants might differ from truncating __ATM__ mutations in their effect on __ATM__ activity and hence cancer susceptibility .
They predicted that carriers of __ATM__ truncations would have 50% of wild-type __ATM__ activity and a normal phenotype .
Individuals with two truncations would have essentially no __ATM__ protein and would have ataxia-telangiectasia .
By contrast , they postulated that certain __ATM__ missense variants might encode functionally abnormal proteins that could act in a dominant-negative fashion , which would therefore have more substantial effects on __ATM__ function than a single truncating mutation .
This could result in distinct phenotypic consequences in carriers of __ATM__ missense variants , such as cancer susceptibility .
However , individuals with two missense variants would not have sufficient abrogation of __ATM__ activity to result in ataxia-telangiectasia .
Although this model can explain the apparent absence of enrichment of __ATM__ truncating mutations in individuals with breast cancer , it does not easily explain the increased risk of breast cancer in female relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia cases .
Over the last decade numerous studies have been performed to try to clarify the role of __ATM__ in breast cancer susceptibility .
The majority of these studies have been inconclusive primarily due to two constraining factors .
First , most have included small numbers of cases , partly because __ATM__ is large and arduous to screen .
Second , very few studies have screened the whole __ATM__ gene in both cases and controls , thereby limiting the ability to directly compare the frequency and type of identified sequence variants .
This is particularly important with respect to missense variants , which are common throughout the genome .
For variants of appreciable prevalence , a comparison of the frequency of the specific variant in cases and controls can be undertaken .
However , for rare missense variants , the absence of the specific variant in controls confirms that it is rare but gives very little information about the potential role of the variant in cancer susceptibility .
Demonstration of an effect on __ATM__ function is supportive that the variant might be associated with a given phenotype , but does not in itself prove that the variant confers susceptibility to breast cancer .
To clarify the role of __ATM__ in breast cancer susceptibility we recently conducted an analysis that attempted to overcome these difficulties .
We adopted a familial case vs control design using 443 BRCA1 / 2 negative familial breast cancer cases and 521 controls .
This design gives an approximately fourfold increase in power over unselected breast cancer cases .
We also screened the full gene in all cases and all controls so that the frequency and spectrum of mutations could be evaluated in a direct , unbiased analysis .
We identified two __ATM__ mutations that cause ataxia-telangiectasia in controls and 12 in familial breast cancer cases ( P=0.0043 ) .
These mutations included truncations , splice-site abnormalities and two missense mutations that were known to affect protein function and to cause ataxia-telangiectasia .
These results are fully consistent with epidemiological studies that predict that __ATM__ mutations that cause ataxia telangiectasia should occur at increased frequency in breast cancer .
As both cases and controls were fully screened through the gene , a direct comparison of the frequency and type of missense mutations in cases and controls could be undertaken .
We identified 37 nonsynonymous missense variants of which 12 were present in both cases and controls , 15 were present exclusively in cases and 10 were present exclusively in controls .
For commoner missense variants such as S49C , F858L , P1054R , L1420F and D1853N there was no difference in variant frequency in cases and controls , consistent with most of the previous studies that have examined these variants .
Of the rare missense mutations , two were previously known to cause ataxia-telangiectasia , T7271G ( V2424G ) and SV28552856RI , and these were only present in cases .
Of note , there was no significant difference in the frequency of nonsynonymous missense variants that occurred either exclusively in cases or exclusively in controls .
Neither was there any significant difference in the predicted pathogenicity or position with respect to functional domains of these variants in cases and controls .
These data highlight the difficulty in deducing the phenotypic consequences of sequence changes that do not result in protein truncation .
Undoubtedly certain nonsynonymous missense variants can cause ataxia-telangiectasia and it is anticipated that such variants also confer susceptibility to breast cancer .
The effects of other missense variants , not already known to be associated with ataxia-telangiectasia , are more difficult to predict , but our data suggest that the majority are not associated with increased risks of breast cancer .
The relative risk of breast cancer associated with __ATM__ mutations was estimated to be 2.37 ( 95% CI=1.51 - 3.78 , P=0.0003 ) by segregation analysis incorporating information from the controls and the full pedigrees of the cases .
This is very similar to the risks estimated from epidemiological analyses .
Therefore , the recent large epidemiological and molecular analyses of __ATM__ have provided entirely consistent data that indicate that __ATM__ mutations that cause ataxia-telangiectasia are low penetrance breast cancer susceptibility alleles conferring approx2-fold risks of breast cancer .
Moreover , the analyses demonstrate that , in the UK population , the combined __ATM__ mutation prevalence is similar to that of CHEK2*1100delC , and that __ATM__ mutations are associated with similar risks of breast cancer and make a similar contribution to breast cancer incidence as CHEK2*1100delC ( Renwick et al. , 2006 ; Nevanlinna and Bartek , 2006 , this issue ) .
Future challenges
Although substantial progress has been made in our understanding of the role of __ATM__ in breast cancer susceptibility there are several questions that need further investigation , such as the identification of factors that determine breast cancer occurrence in __ATM__ mutation carriers , risks of other cancers , whether __ATM__ heterozygotes are more sensitive to radiation and the clinical utility / implementation of __ATM__ mutation testing .
Age and mutation specific risks
Overall , all __ATM__ mutations together confer a approx2-fold risk of breast cancer .
However , there are indications that factors such as age and the specific mutation may influence breast cancer risk .
Epidemiological analyses suggest that the risk of breast cancer in __ATM__ carriers is higher in women under 50 years and may be higher in first-degree relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia cases compared to more distantly related __ATM__ heterozygotes .
The breast cancer risk in individuals above and below 50 years was not significantly different in the study by Renwick_et_al. but there was limited power to investigate the age-specific risks of __ATM__ mutations .
Nevertheless , the estimate was consistent with the higher risks in younger individuals reported in epidemiological studies .
The age-specific risks associated with __ATM__ mutations will need further investigation .
Another question that needs further research is whether there are mutation-specific differences in cancer risk .
One particular mutation , T7271G , has been proposed to have a higher risk of breast cancer .
This mutation was originally identified in two families with a mild form of ataxia-telangiectasia associated with slowly progressing ataxia , minimal telangiectasia and fertility and is associated with low levels of kinase activity .
In the first of the families , two individuals homozygous for T7271G developed breast cancer at 44 and 50 years and their mother , an obligate carrier of the mutation , developed breast cancer at 82 years .
In the second family , two brothers with ataxia-telangiectasia were compound heterozygotes for T7271G and a truncating mutation .
Three paternal aunts of the brothers developed breast cancer in their 50 's one of whom was confirmed to be a heterozygous T7271G carrier .
Subsequently , an Australian family was reported in which five women with breast cancer were heterozygous T7271G carriers .
Expression and activity analyses of __ATM__ in cell lines from the carriers suggested that the mutation acts in a dominant negative fashion .
It is noteworthy that in our study of __ATM__ in familial breast cancer , the only mutation that was identified more than once was T7271G , which was identified in the index case of two families that each included three first-degree relatives with breast cancer .
This mutation was not detected in the 528 controls and has been shown to be very rare in several other studies .
These data suggest that the T72721G mutation may be associated with higher risks of breast cancer , but further studies are required to evaluate this .
Other phenotypic features in __ATM__ heterozygotes
The original report of cancer in relatives of ataxia-telangiectasia cases suggested that cancers other than breast cancer , such as stomach , pancreas , bladder and ovarian cancer may also occur at increased frequency in __ATM__ heterozygotes .
Subsequent studies have provided inconclusive and / or inconsistent data about whether / which additional cancers are associated with __ATM__ heterozygosity .
Further , larger studies will be required to investigate the role of __ATM__ in susceptibility to cancers other than breast cancer .
Whether __ATM__ heterozygosity is associated with increased sensitivity to radiation is also unclear and has been the subject of several small studies .
Radiosensitivity is a hallmark of ataxia-telangectasia cells and cells from __ATM__ heterozygotes show intermediate sensitivity to ionizing radiation in various assays based on cell survival .
However , it remains unclear whether cells from __ATM__ heterozygotes exhibit clinically relevant radiosensitivity in vivo .
It has also been hypothesized that __ATM__ heterozygotes may be over-represented in the proportion of breast cancer cases that exhibit exaggerated acute or late reaction of normal tissues following radiotherapy .
Given the increased risk of breast cancer in __ATM__ heterozygotes the response to radiation therapy is of potential clinical importance and requires further investigation .
Clinical implementation
The demonstration that __ATM__ mutations predispose to breast cancer could be used in risk stratification in women without cancer , to allow them to make medical and lifestyle choices to reduce their risk of breast cancer .
The utility of genetic testing of breast cancer genes in reducing cancer incidence has been comprehensively demonstrated for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes ( Domchek and Weber , 2006 , this issue ) .
However , mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 confer approx15-fold risks of breast cancer and >70% of women with mutations in these genes will develop the disease .
By contrast , women with __ATM__ mutations have a approx2-fold risk of breast cancer and only approx15% of women with such mutations will develop the disease .
Currently , it is not known what determines which women with __ATM__ mutations will develop cancer and this limits the clinical utility of identifying such mutations .
However , if __ATM__ mutations act multiplicatively or epistatically with other genetic or nongenetic breast cancer susceptibility factors it may be possible to identify women with combinations of low penetrance factors that together give risks similar to those of BRCA1 / 2 .
Such women may benefit from surveillance and surgical interventions similar to those that have proved so successful in BRCA1 / 2 carriers ( Domchek and Weber , 2006 , this issue ) .
__ATM__ mutation status may also be of relevance to the treatment of breast cancer if it influences response to radiation or the efficacy of specific chemotherapies as has been suggested for BRCA-deficient tumours ( Gudmundsdottir and Ashworth , 2006 , this issue ) .
