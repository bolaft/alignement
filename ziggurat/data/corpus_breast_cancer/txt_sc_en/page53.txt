Aim
To obtain better survival estimates for the individual than is provided by placement in an __NPI__ group .
1. Introduction
The __NPI__ is widely used for the estimation of prognosis of primary breast cancers .
The Index integrates independently significant prognostic factors recognised in multivariate analysis and satisfies the criteria for a method of good prognostic discrimination : accurate recognition of groups with significantly differing survival chances and small confidence intervals ; placement of sufficient percentages of cases into each group ; prospective validation in other tumour sets both - intra1 and inter centre, application to young women6 ; to pre- and post-menopausal women ; to small tumours7 ; to cases detected at screening as well as presenting symptomatically8 ; ease and low cost of evaluation .
At present the Index is used to stratify to six groups and the prognosis for the individual is given as that of the group in which the patient lies .
This represents an average , for the group covering a range of __NPI__ values of 1.0. This paper describes a method for the allocation of the survival chance for an individual __NPI__ score .
2. Materials and methods
The derivation of the NPI,9 verification and methods for measurement and calculation10 have been previously described .
The __NPI__ is calculat__LN__ Stage ( measured 1 - 3 ) and Size ( 0.2 × maximum diameter in cm ) .
The higher the __NPI__ the worse the outcome ; the range of values of __NPI__ is from 2.04 to 6.98 ; the range of 10 year survival estimates is between 33% for the Very Poor Prognostic Group and 95% for the Excellent Prognostic Group .
The survival of breast cancers has improved since the 1980s , when the __NPI__ was first described and survival figures for __NPI__ groups have been updated by analysis of cases treated in 1990 - 1999.11
2.1. Patients
The data set is consecutive cases of primary operable ( tumour diameter <5 cm ) invasive breast cancer , in women aged 70 or less , undergoing surgery at Nottingham City Hospital in 1990 - 1999 ( inclusive ) , originally under the care of a single surgeon ( RWB ) and later under the care of the multidisciplinary Nottingham Breast Unit ( n = 2261 ) .
Adjuvant systemic therapies were protocolled according to the __NPI__ group in which the patient lay .
Systemic therapy was prescribed to the Excellent and Good Prognostic Groups .
The Moderate I group received hormonal therapy for ER positive tumours .
The Moderate II , Poor and Very Poor Groups received hormone therapy for ER positive tumours and cytotoxic therapy for ER negative .
All patients have been followed up regularly in the hospital __PBC__ and data on survival and recurrence recorded .
At death , the hospital notes are examined and deaths allocated to With or from breast cancer or to Without known breast cancer .
Patients with previously diagnosed distant metastatic spread , even if in complete remission are allocated the former ; women dying without prior distant recurrence and without uncontrolled local or regional recurrence , are allocated the latter ( unless a post-mortem study indicates otherwise ) .
The survival curves may then be constructed for both breast cancer specific and for death from all causes .
Median follow-up is 8.3 years to May 2005 .
3. Results
For the 1990 - 1999 tumours 10 year life table based survivals ( breast cancer specific ) have been examined ( Kaplan - Meier ) for 10 ranges of __NPI__ from 2.0 upwards ; survival descends in rank order from 96% in the 2 - 2.4 __NPI__ range to 37% at 6.41 - 7.0 ; 95% confidence limits are also shown .
Fig. 1 shows the plot of these percentage 10 year survivals , against the median __NPI__ for each range .
Superimposed is the line of best-fit obtained using a second-order polynomial function ( r2 = 0.98 ) .
Other curvilinear functions were tested but showed lower regression coefficients ( data not presented ) .
The expected 10 year breast cancer specific survival for an individual __NPI__ value is obtained by applying the formula : - 3.0079 × NPI2 + 12.295 × __NPI__ + 83.84.
Interpolation models using continuous __NPI__ , NPI-squared and NPI-cubed covariates were also developed ( __NPI__ scale = 0.1 ) .
These models had r2-values of 0.60 , 0.61 , and 0.61 , respectively .
The line of best fit equations were %10 year survival = - 4.07NPI2 + 22.96NPI + 56.97 , %10 year survival = - 0.04 ( NPI2 ) 2 + 0.22 NPI2 + 88.56 and %10 year survival = - 0.00042 ( NPI3 ) 2 - 0.097NPI3 + 90.17 , respectively .
These showed significantly poorer performance than the interpolation model using higher resolution .
Cox regression was not conducted on these variables as the purpose of this paper was to evaluate the existing __NPI__ derived from Cox regression on new data and not to derive a new __NPI__ .
To investigate the validity of the fitted response curves summarising the relationship between __NPI__ and % 10 year survival , the data were divided into two groups ( odds and evens on the data base of cases entered consecutively ) , for which curves were plotted using second-order polynomial function .
Data were applied reciprocally between one curve and the other to predict survival as if on blind data .
The results of the analysis indicate a general concordance between the two graphs and no significant difference as identified by the confidence intervals of the points .
The greatest differences between the curves occurred at the high __NPI__ values where the confidence limits were greatest .
4. Discussion
A prognostic estimate is given for any individual with primary breast cancer .
Although the group value is usually a good enough estimate in clinical work , in certain cases the individual estimate is better .
Internal validation for individual values is impossible without a very large series , since numbers are only high enough for validating the __NPI__ group predictions .
Internal validation by splitting patients to 10 ranges of __NPI__ retaining rank order of survival and the assumption that this would be preserved on splitting to more groups and finally to individual values seem reasonable .
The fitted polynomial curves show no significant differences between the two halves of the split set .
As examples of cases in which the individual values appear to reflect predicted outcome better than by using the __NPI__ groups :
1. Two patients with __NPI__ 's differing little , of 5.4 and 5.5 lie in different __NPI__ groups ( Moderate II and Poor ) , giving estimated breast cancer specific 10 year survivals of 75% and 53% , respectively , a 22% difference .
Calculation for the individual from the formula for the individual __NPI__ values gives their survivals as 63% and 60% respectively , only a 3% difference .
2. Two patients have __NPI__ 's of 4.5 and 5.4 ; they both lie in MPG II therefore giving no apparent difference in their estimated 10 year group survivals of 75% .
However , from the formula , their individualised survivals are 78% and 63% respectively , a 15% difference .
Whilst the relative risk reduction from adjuvant therapies is well known , the potential absolute gain is the important knowledge for patient and clinician .
Knowledge of the predicted 10 year survival is essential in estimating the magnitude of absolute gain to the individual from adjuvant therapies and in explaining the importance of these therapies.12
The individual estimate is also likely to be of particular use in estimation of loss of life expectancy in medico-legal cases , for which because of the shape of the survival curves , a 10% difference in 10 year survival transforms to a very large difference in life expectancy .
The method of prognostic prediction presented here gives greater accuracy in assessing the survival chance for the individual than that obtained for the __NPI__ group in which the patient lies .
