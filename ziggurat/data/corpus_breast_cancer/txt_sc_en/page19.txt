Introduction
Breast cancer is the commonest malignancy occurring in women .
It affects 1 in 9 women in the UK , with 41,000 new cases per year.1 Early detection of malignant breast lesions has been facilitated by the introduction of mammographic screening services .
An early diagnosis makes patients eligible for various treatment options .
Randomised controlled trials have shown equal survival benefits after __MRM__ or __MRM__ combined with radiotherapy.2 , 3 and 4 Patients with tumours measuring under 4 cm or over 4 cm in a large breast are suitable for breast conserving surgery .
Patients may find making decisions regarding treatment at the time of diagnosis with breast cancer difficult .
Making a decision under such circumstances can increase the confusion and anxiety experienced by a newly diagnosed patient and a perceived need for haste can worsen the situation .
Geographical variations in treatment received have been attributed to institutional , practitioner and patient factors.5 and 6 Patients are increasingly becoming involved in the decision-making process .
As treatment outcomes are the same , the patient often makes the final decision .
This study aims to examine the relationship between the patient 's socio-demographic factors and treatment choice for breast cancer suitable for conservation therapy , as well as assessing patients satisfaction with their choice of therapy .
Methods
The study population included a random selection of patients with small breast cancers ( Tless-than-or-equals , slant2 , N 1 ) suitable for primary surgery and treated with either breast conservation ( wide local excision and radiotherapy ) or mastectomy with or without reconstruction .
All patients were treated at the Cardiff Breast Unit and diagnosed through rapid access breast clinics or through the Breast Test Wales screening programme .
Before treatment , a surgeon and breast specialist nurse counselled all patients about treatment options .
No set protocol was in place at the time of the study regarding time of reconstruction if offered .
Patients attending follow-up clinic between June and July 2000 were asked to participate in the study and given information about the study prior to deciding whether to be included or not .
The same female interviewer questioned all participants .
Information was collected from patient interviews and medical records .
A structured interview based on a pre-designed questionnaire that focused on social and demographic factors ( age , nationality , marital status and education ) was used .
Further questions concerned the decision-making process , prior thoughts on breast cancer treatment , perceptions and satisfaction of their treatment choice and the recommendation of the treating surgeon , breast specialist nurse , family and friends .
The patient 's method of diagnosis ( symptomatic / screened ) , time interval from surgery to clinic visit , family history , surgeon , breast specialist nurse , tumour histology ( size and grade ) , and node status was obtained from case records .
Women initially choosing breast conservation who eventually required mastectomy for involved tissue margins were classed as having had __BC__ .
Women with nodal involvement were generally offered radiotherapy at their oncology consultation .
Socio-economic status was measured using the Townsend deprivation index.7 This is a measure of deprivation based on home ownership , overcrowding , unemployment and car ownership that can be calculated using electoral wards .
Using the postcode of residence , each women was ascribed her electoral ward Townsend score .
Patients were then grouped into quintiles of deprivation with 5 representing the most deprived group .
The Student T-test or analysis of variance was used to test for differences between the median ages as appropriate .
Chi-squared test for linear trend was used to test trends across quintiles of deprivation score .
The variables found to be significantly associated with treatment choice in the univariate analysis were entered into logistic regression model to assess how much each variable contributed to predicting treatment choice ( P<0.005 was considered statistically significant ) .
Results
During the 2 month period , a total of 202 patients were interviewed .
Median age at treatment was 57 ( 32 - 90 ) years .
Ninety-seven per cent of patients were born in the United Kingdom and 3% were born overseas .
Forty-five per cent were symptomatic and 55% screen detected .
Median time from surgery to interview was 40 months ( 1 month - 15 years ) .
One hundred and twenty-one ( 60% ) patients choose __BC__ , 81 patients ( 40% ) choose __MRM__ , 10 ( 5% ) of whom had a reconstruction .
There was no statistical difference between treatment choice and method of detection .
The mean age of women choosing __MRM__ was 61 compared to 55 for those choosing __BC__ ( P<0.0001 ) .
Seventy-seven per cent of patients had a partner when undergoing surgery .
Women without partners were 60% more likely to choose __MRM__ ( P=0.009 ) .
The median age of women without partners ( 66 years ) was higher than the median age of women with partners ( 54 years ; P<0.001 ) .
Women with no family history of breast cancer were more likely to choose mastectomy than women with a family history ( P=0.02 ) .
There was not a significant association ( P=0.065 ) seen between the age at which the patient left education and treatment choice .
Fifty-eight per cent of patients who choose __MRM__ left school below the age of 16 , compared with 41% of the __BC__ group .
Fourteen patients ( 12% ) who underwent __BC__ attended university , compared with 4 patients ( 6% ) who chose __MRM__ .
No association was seen between deprivation and treatment choice .
There was no evidence of association between any of the four surgeons who treated the patient group or the six breast care nurses and treatment choice .
Mean histological tumour diameter was smaller for women choosing __BC__ ( 15 mm ) than for women choosing mastectomy ( 17 mm ; P=0.014 ) .
There was no association between grade of tumour and treatment choice .
Prior to attending breast clinic 36% of patients thought that mastectomy was the only treatment option for breast cancer .
Twenty-two per cent felt that this was a more effective treatment than wide local excision .
Eighty-two per cent were surprised at being asked to take part in deciding what treatment they would receive and 12% would have liked more time to arrive at this decision .
Over 90% of patients thought they had received sufficient information to make an informed choice .
A high proportion of __BC__ patients ( 40% ) found their procedure more disfiguring than anticipated .
Twelve per cent of women who originally had __BC__ would have retrospectively preferred a mastectomy ( 6 of these patients underwent completion mastectomy , 3 had complications from their surgery and 2 feared cancer recurrence ) .
Fifty-eight per cent of patients who had a mastectomy found the operation more disfiguring than expected and 6% would have preferred breast conservation .
The main reasons patients gave for choosing mastectomy were fear of cancer recurrence , concerns over the potential side effects of radiotherapy and wanting a rapid solution for domestic or employment reasons .
Patients choosing __BC__ felt that local excision would be less disfiguring , less surgery would be involved , and the long-term outcome was the same as mastectomy .
Patients choosing __MRM__ were primarily influenced by their surgeon , followed by spouse / partner and finally the breast care nurse .
The converse was true for patients opting for __BC__ with the patient 's spouse / partner having the greatest influence .
Eighty-four per cent of women were offered reconstruction but only 12% accepted .
The main reasons given for choosing reconstruction was to avoid radiotherapy , a perceived decrease risk of tumour recurrence with reconstruction , the influence of others and not wanting to wear prosthesis .
Avoiding further surgery and disappointment with cosmetic results seen in photographs of other patients were given as the main reasons given for declining reconstruction .
Discussion
Randomised controlled trials have shown equal benefits in terms of survival for breast cancer treated with either __MRM__ or BC2 , 3 and 4 M. Blichert-Toft , A Danish randomised trial comparing breast conservation with mastectomy in mammary carcinoma , Br J Cancer 62 ( 1990 ) ( 12 ) , p. 15.4 leading to patients becoming increasingly involved in the decision-making process about which treatment modality they will receive.8 Patients are capable of choosing their treatment and do not necessarily choose breast conservation if it is offered.9 However , progressively more women treated at our unit have chosen __BC__ over the last decade .
Factors influencing patient 's choice of treatment and the psychological impact of decision-making are poorly understood .
In our study group age was the strongest predictor of patient choice with older patients more likely to choose mastectomy .
Women with larger tumours were similarly more likely to choose mastectomy .
Single women were 60% more likely to choose __MRM__ than women who were married or had a partner .
Women who have had a mastectomy may feel less attractive and sexually desirable than patients who have had BC,10 which may account for the predominance of __BC__ in women with a partner .
Previous studies have shown that patient 's choice of treatment is unrelated to race.11 The ethnic distribution of our study group was influenced by the population within the catchment area of the breast unit .
Ninety-seven per cent of patients were Caucasian so we cannot reliably comment on a preference for treatment choice related to racial differences .
Education may be a significant variable relating to patients treatment choice , with better-educated patients more likely to choose breast conservation.11 In the group studied , more patients who left school below the age of 16 choose __MRM__ and more patients who choose breast conservation had attended university although the association was not statistically significant .
There is no clear evidence that women who undergo mastectomy are more likely to suffer psychiatric morbidity than those who have had breast conservation.12 Patients who are not offered a choice of treatment experience significantly higher levels of anxiety and depression pre- and up to 2 months post-operatively than women not offered a treatment choice ( with similar results seen in the patient 's husband ) .
Women who are offered a choice of treatment have similar levels of anxiety to patients undergoing surgery for benign disease and simply involving patients in the decision-making process may have marked psychological benefits.13
Patient 's choice of treatment is unrelated to the amount of information received during the clinic visit or the manner in which information is given.8 Patient 's recall of information about treatment and associated risks is exceedingly poor,8 and despite being informed to the contrary patients often feel that their chosen treatment provides the best chance of a cure.14
Conclusion
Ninety-four per cent of patients felt that enough information was available to make an informed choice and a majority were satisfied with the service offered .
Only 12% of patients would have liked more time to come to a decision and a significant percentage of patients found their operation more disfiguring than expected ( 58% for __MRM__ and 40% for __BC__ ) .
Only 6% of patients who had __MRM__ and 12% who had __BC__ regretted their choice of treatment .
No association between treatment choice and deprivation , age of leaving education and surgeon or breast care nurse was seen .
Older patients , those with larger tumours and those without partners were more likely to choose mastectomy .
The study does have several limitations .
Only 19% of patients were aged under 50 years , we are relying on patients recall of events that happened months or even years previously and we have no measure to confirm that a discussion on breast treatment options took place and what the contents of this discussion were .
