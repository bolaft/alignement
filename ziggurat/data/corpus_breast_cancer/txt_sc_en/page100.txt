The routine adjuvant endocrine standard of care for post menopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer has shifted towards including an __AI__ , following the evidence presented in five international trials demonstrating improved disease-free survival with __AI__ containing regimens , compared to tamoxifen alone .
It is , however , unlikely that all post menopausal women , particularly those with a good prognosis , where the relapse rate is low on either drug , have a clinically relevant advantage .
Subgroups of patients have been identified who would benefit the most from __AIs__ over tamoxifen , and particularly benefit from initial selection rather than sequencing a switch at 2 years .
These include pathological prognostic factors which predict a higher and earlier relapse rate , such as histological grade , presence of vascular invasion , tumour size and number of positive axillary nodes ; Biological molecular markers such a Cerb2 , Ki67 , CYP-2D6 , level of oestrogen receptor positivity , progesterone receptor negativity ; Patient-related factors such as a history of thromboembolic disease , risk of uterine carcinoma or osteoporosis .
The roles played by quality of life , tolerance and patient preference in the choice for either __AI__ or tamoxifen ; however , has not been formally established previously .
Menopausal symptoms and overall quality of life have been extensively investigated within adjuvant breast cancer studies ( Baum , 2001 ; Coombes et al , 2004 ; BIG 1-98 Collaborative Group , 2005 ; Boccardo et al , 2005 ; Jakesz et al , 2005 ) , with particular scrutiny within the ATAC and IES trials .
In these studies arthralgia and vaginal dryness was more prevalent with __AIs__ and night sweats and vaginal discharge with tamoxifen but there was no difference in overall quality of life .
Most women in these studies , fortunately , had no significant menopausal symptoms on either treatment .
In daily practise , however , the clinically more relevant but unanswered question , was whether switching to an __AI__ in the 30% already intolerant of tamoxifen improved or compromised quality of life .
This study assessed the short-term effect on hot flushes , mood and quality of life , and the longer-term effect on arthralgia and preference for tamoxifen or __AI__ , subsequent to giving patients personal experience of both drugs within a prospective crossover design .
The results aimed to supplement existing histological and patient oriented factors , to aid the decision for either early switching to __AI__ or continuing tamoxifen .
METHODOLOGY
This open-label , crossover trial assessed post menopausal women with oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer , experiencing troublesome hot flushes while taking adjuvant tamoxifen .
One hundred and eighty four women were recruited between March 2005 and February 2007 at the Primrose Oncology Research Unit , Bedford Hospital , UK and Russells Hall Hospital , Dudley , UK .
Ethics approval was sought , and given , for this study .
Patient selection
All 184 women gave written informed consent and had been taking adjuvant tamoxifen for at least 3 months prior to trial entry .
The average age was 58.8 years ( range , 40.6-88.7 years ) .
The average time on tamoxifen was 15.5 months ( 3-62 months ) .
The average time from diagnosis to switching to an __AI__ was 20.34 months ( range , 9-88 months ) , 54 ( 29% ) had received adjuvant chemotherapy .
Patients had a histological or cytological __ER__ positivity and were post menopausal at the time of initiation of __AI__ , as defined by ; no spontaneous menses for at least 2 years , or spontaneous menses within the past 2 years , but amenorrhoeic for at least 12 months and oestrodiol , LH and FSH values according to the definition of postmenopausal normal range of the laboratory involved ; or bilateral oophorectomy or radiation castration and amenorrheic for at least 3 months or medical oophorectomy with administration of LHRH agonists .
In all 48 ( 26% ) were deemed to be menopausal when they first started taking adjuvant tamoxifen patients but then met the definition of postmenopausal at trial entry .
Patients scored >3 on the NCI toxicity score or had average of 14 significant hot flushes per week .
All women had tried , or were offered , lifestyle advice for hot flushes , including our written guidance sheet ( coping with hot flushes - available on ) .
No women were taking venlafaxine or clonidine at trial entry .
Many women had tried over the counter remedies for hot flushes ( evening Primrose Oil , Black Cohosh ) but were excluded if these started within 1 month before the trial period , otherwise these were allowed as long as they continued unchanged .
Tolerance assessment
Hot flushes score : The __HFD__ and scoring system used as the primary end point in this study were originally developed and validated by Sloan_et_al .
The __HFD__ is an internationally accepted tool for evaluating and comparing hot flushes strategies , and has been used in a number of randomised trials such as those involving venlafaxine , clonidine and fluoxetine .
The scoring system gives an indication of frequency and severity by grading hot flushes into mild , moderate , severe and very severe , over a 24 h period .
In this study , as these forms were self completed by patients at home , they were also given a leaflet defining the grades of hot flushes to help them complete the __HFD__ .
As recommended in previous validation studies , despite these grading systems , it was still ultimately the patient 's own interpretation of severity that was scored .
In other words , if a woman told us she had a severe hot flush , we did not feel that it was appropriate for us to tell her it was only a mild hot flush .
Quality of life : The __FACT__ , breast version with Endocrine Symptom add-ons ( FACT-B+ES ) was used .
This questionnaire covers physical as well as psychological symptoms , and includes a component designed specifically for women with breast cancer who receive hormonal therapy .
The FACT-ES has been validated in the advanced breast cancer setting , and has been shown to have good internal consistency , reliability , patient acceptability and sensitivity to clinically significant change .
It has been used in the majority of large adjuvant __AI__ studies .
The Mood Rating Scale : The __MRS__ is a self-reported measure of normal mood , which consists of six 150 mm visual analogue subscales with defined anchor points .
The subscales are : tense-relaxed , sad-happy , tired-energetic , confused-clear headed , irritable-easy-going , unsure-confident .
The six subscales can be summated to obtain a single total score .
Reliability and validity have been found to be good , and the scale has been shown to be responsive to the effects of cancer therapies , psychological interventions and work-induced stress .
It takes approximately one minute to complete .
The patient preference questionnaire : The patient preference questionnaire was originally developed by one of the trial committee as a tool to formalise and grade the strength of a patient 's choice .
It has been used as an end point in a subsequent crossover trial involving __AIs__ , and consistently correlated with quality of life and degree of side effects .
Patients are asked to indicate which drug they tolerated better overall , the reasons for this choice , the level of confidence in their decision , and their general views on the appropriateness of being asked the question .
Patient preference has been used in a number of other trials on subjects ranging from oral vs i.v. chemotherapy , to choices between chemotherapy and hormone therapies .
Arthralgia grading system : The NCI system was used , which grades severity into mild , moderate , severe and very severe ( National Cancer Institute , 1999 ) .
Study design
Following written informed consent obtained while taking tamoxifen 20 mg per day , women completed a 1 week __HFD__ , the FACT-B+ES questionnaire , an __MRS__ and an NCI arthralgia grading scale .
They were then switched to an __AI__ .
The same questionnaires plus a __PPQ__ were given to patients for completion at home , and they were asked to post back to the trial centre ( to minimise social compliance effects ) .
For the first 104 patients in the study , letrozole 2.5 mg per day was prescribed : the next 80 patients were given exemestane 25 mg per day .
The women either continued on their prescribed __AI__ or changed back to tamoxifen , based on their patient preference and quality of life questionnaires .
A further arthralgia NCI grading score and __PPQ__ was completed by patients at 3 months .
At any stage after the initial 6 week trial , women were given the opportunity to switch back to tamoxifen if they subsequently developed troublesome side effects on their __AI__ , and in each case the trial office was informed .
All women who chose an __AI__ were given Lifestyle & __AI__ guidance sheet ( available from ) and their names were entered into the standard bone density surveillance programme .
Statistical considerations : The methodology and analysis was conducted at Cranfield University .
The primary end point was the hot flush score ( __HFS__ intensity number as assessed by the __HFD__ ) .
It was intended that both the letrozole and exemestane phases were statistically and independently powered .
Sample size consideration
The number of patients for the first ( letrozole ) phase was determined using classic power analysis characteristics , based on previous studies in populations of patients with hot flushes .
In these trials , with 50 patients per group , the studies had 80% power to detect differences in average hot flush activity of 0.6 s.d. using a standard two-sample t-test with a two-sided type I error rate of 5% .
Hence , 50 patients per treatment arm provided an 80% power to detect an average shift of 1.2 hot flushes per day or a hot flush score of three units per day .
Smaller differences were regarded as not clinically significant .
Other trials using similar methodologies had statistically proven benefits of hot flush remedies using similar patient numbers .
The use of a crossover design , in this study , increased power as patients acted as their own controls .
Placebo effect consideration
It has been recognised in previous hot flush studies that a placebo effect may reduce hot flush activity up to approximately 25% , that is , to 75% of baseline .
In view of this placebo effect , a further 30 patients were added , or required , to ensure a minimum of 80% power to detect a difference in average hot flush activity of 0.6 s.d. ( a reduction of 25% plus 1.2 hot flushes per day or a reduction of the score by 25% plus a score of three units ) with a type 1 error rate of 5% .
That is , if a woman has six hot flushes per day , a reduction to an average of 3.3 would be regarded as significant .
As an extra reassurance in the first letrozole phase , a further 20 patients were added .
Because an interim analysis of this first phase ( letrozole ) comfortably reached statistical significance , the second ( exemestane ) phase adhered to the precise power recommendation of 80 patients .
Statistical analysis
The __HFS__ , __MRS__ and FACT-B+ES were analysed using parametric analysis of variance .
This was considered the most robust method , as even with non-normal data , the estimated least square means and their confidence intervals of these data were sound .
Retrospective analysis of errors showed that there was no serious departure from normally distributed errors , and there was constant variance across all the predicted means .
The total __FACT__ ( b+es ) , its six subscales were also analysed using the analysis of variance method with all the considerations made according to the original __FACT__ guidance manual .
Similarly , the __MRS__ data was analysed using analysis of variance .
Pearson chi2 tests were used to analyse the __PPQ__ and arthralgia scores .
RESULTS
One hundred and eighty-four patients entered the study .
One patient had demonstrated signs of relapse by 6 weeks , and by 3 months , five in total had relapsed .
All completed their questionnaires and were included in the analysis .
The data was analysed in three separate groups ; all patients combined ; the letrozole phase alone , and the exemestane phase alone .
During the recruitment period for this trial , only two further eligible patients declined trial entry , suggesting the trial cohort closely reflected routine oncology practise .
Hot flushes
The severity of hot flushes , following 6 weeks __AI__ , almost halved from those experienced on tamoxifen , as measured by the __HFS__ ( 47.3% , P<0.001 ) .
Among the 133 ( 72% ) who chose __AI__ , the difference in __HFS__ was understandably even larger at 6 weeks ( P<0.0001 ) .
Quality of life
The total mean combined __FACT__ ( b+es ) score improved by 6.5% , from 134.2 ( 95% CI ±2.96 ) , to 143.5 ( 95% CI ±2.96 , P<0.001 ) .
The endocrine subscale improved by 9.8% from 51.73 ( 95% CI ±1.38 ) to 57.34 ( 95% CI ±1.38 , P<0.001 ) .
All other subscales also reached significance .
Mood
Total __MRS__ scores , improved by 9.7% from 49.4 ( 95% CI ±2.48 ) to 54.7 mm ( 95% CI ±2.48 , P=0.005 ) .
Patient preference
At six weeks , 133 ( 72% ) preferred to remain on an __AI__ as they felt their menopausal symptoms and other side effects were better .
Forty ( 22% ) patients felt that they were better on tamoxifen and 11 ( 6% ) discontinued adjuvant hormones altogether as they decided the side effects on either hormone did not justify their adjuvant benefits .
At or after 3 months , 107 ( 58% ) remained on an __AI__ , 55 ( 30% ) stayed on tamoxifen , and 19 ( 10.3% ) of those originally choosing an __AI__ resumed tamoxifen , primarily due to the development of troublesome arthralgia .
One switched from tamoxifen to exemestane .
Twenty-two ( 12% ) women , following discussion chose to discontinue hormone therapy altogether .
Arthralgia
The overall arthralgia rate among the 173 still in the study after 6 weeks ( 11 had withdrawn ) , and choosing an __AI__ was 47% during __AI__ administration , and those on tamoxifen was 30% ( Pearson chi2 , P=0.001 ) .
This was mainly due to the difference in severe arthralgia ( T 0% vs __AI__ 13% ) , as there was no significant difference in the mild to moderate rates .
The same trends were seen in the individual analysis of letrozole and exemestane .
One hundred and eighty ( 98% ) patients indicated on the final questionnaire that they appreciated the opportunity to experience both drugs , and to be able to make choices for themselves between hot flushes and arthralgia .
Although not initially part of the analysis plan , a direct comparison of letrozole vs exemestane showed no difference between them in any predetermined trial end point category .
DISCUSSION
Menopausal symptoms , particularly hot flushes , significantly impair quality of life in women with breast cancer , who have a significantly higher incidence of these symptoms than the general population .
Premenopausal women may have undergone premature menopause from chemotherapy or ovarian ablation , and post menopausal women can endure sudden interruption of their __HRT__ , causing a recognised rebound to severe climacteric symptoms .
On top of this , they are prescribed drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors , which make them worse .
The most widely used non-oestrogenic therapeutic interventions for hot flushes in women with breast cancer , include progestogens , clonidine and venlafaxine .
A low dose of progesterone such as medroxyprogesterone acetate ; however , can cause weight gain and increase the risk of thromboembolus , and the longer term risks of its addition to tamoxifen are uncertain .
Clonidine has limited success but can cause troublesome adverse effects of its own .
Venlafaxine has recently been shown to be more affective than clonidine , but women are apprehensive about starting long term antidepressants .
Lifestyle advice such as sensible clothing and avoiding stimulants can be helpful , and hence all patients in this study received our written lifestyle guidance ( Cancernet-UK , 2008 ) .
Dietary supplements such as evening primrose oil are popular , but lack evidence of benefit .
Likewise , complementary interventions such as acupuncture , reflexology and massage , remain unproven remedies .
Randomised controlled trials to evaluate herbal therapies and phytoestrogen supplements have shown limited benefit , and the consensus among oncologists is that , if they do work , their oestrogenic effect may be detrimental in terms of risk of tumour relapse ( MacGregor et al , 2005 ) .
The quality of life benefits of __AIs__ over tamoxifen were not demonstrated within the five large international , published adjuvant breast cancer studies ( Baum , 2001 ; Coombes et al , 2004 ; BIG 1-98 Collaborative Group , 2005 ; Boccardo et al , 2005 ; Jakesz et al , 2005 ) , even though the ATAC and IES trials had further specific scrutiny .
There are two possible explanations for this .
Firstly in the above studies , a significant proportion of women fortunately tolerated both tamoxifen and __AI__ well , so any difference in quality of life between the two groups was diluted by the no side effect cohort ; Second , side effects are more prevalent with __AIs__ in terms of a quality of life analysis , directly balance those more likely in the tamoxifen group ( night sweats and vaginal discharge ) .
The fundamental difference in the cohort of the women evaluated in this paper , is that they all had significant hot flushes at trial entry .
The subsequent 53.7% improvement in hot flushes , in terms of quality of life and preference , in these patients outweighed the 17% deterioration in arthropathy .
Another possibility of the significant findings of this study maybe , albeit unlikely , as a weakness in its open design .
Blinding would have avoided the influence of external sources such as media reports on the benefits of __AIs__ , but the cost of repackaging was prohibitive .
Although the benefits of switching were over and above the anticipated placebo effect , a causal effect should ideally be confirmed by a double-blind , randomised trial .
However , it was in the patient 's interests to be honest about side effects because they would be taking the medication after the 6 week trial period .
Nevertheless , media activity could have biased a small proportion of patients towards __AI__ especially in the group who did not notice much difference between the two drugs .
However , the finding that 30% of women chose tamoxifen at 6 weeks or later , and 12% chose to stop altogether , suggest that patients were more than capable of weighing up the complex issues of risks , benefits and quality of life , provided they were empowered with the appropriate experience .
Furthermore , citations in the UK media , referring to __AIs__ , increased over the duration of the study ( 208 letrozole phase , 303 exemestane ) ( Cision Public Relations , 2005-2007 ) whereas the percentage of patients choosing an __AI__ in the two phases was the same , suggesting media reports were not a strong influence on their decision-making .
Another criticism of the open design may potentially be inadvertent physician bias .
To diminish this risk , all questionnaires were completed outside the clinic environment , and returned to the hospital by post .
There did , however , appear to be a change in physician 's attitudes to the trial entry over the 2 year recruitment period .
Despite the eligibility criteria being the same , the intensity of __HFS__ at trial entry was slightly lower in the later , exemestane group at entry .
This probably reflected changing attitudes in clinicians and patients to switching to __AIs__ as the international evidence emerged .
This trend , although not affecting the statistical power , results and conclusion did highlight that the quality of life benefits of switching applies both to patients who had either severe hot flushes ( __HFS__ mean 97 ) or moderate hot flushes ( __HFS__ mean 70.7 ) .
Despite these caveats in trial design , its strength is that the issues raised very much reflect those confronting patients with breast cancer and oncologists on a daily basis .
The reality that only two tamoxifen-intolerant women declined trial entry strongly suggests that these findings reflect routine clinical practise .
It was also reassuring to report that 99% of patients in the study indicated that they greatly appreciated the opportunity to experience both drugs : implementing a crossover manoeuvre into clinical practise is likely to be widely accepted and appreciated .
This trial also highlights patient 's capacity and enthusiasm , if empowered with personal experiences , to choose which drug best fits their own daily lives , particularly trading off lower hot flushes for higher arthralgia .
The ability to share decisions with their clinicians has previously been a factor associated with improved psychological wellbeing , satisfaction and compliance ( Thomas et al , 1999 , 2000 , 2004 ) .
Although there was a statistical benefit in favour of __AIs__ , it must be emphasised that a significant minority of the women felt worse on __AIs__ .
This resulted in 10% switching back to tamoxifen and 12% of participants withdrawing from hormones altogether , and , no doubt , another group who had considered switching back , but decided to remain on their chosen drug .
In either scenario , patients required considerable discussion with their clinicians within longer and more frequent consultations , which prevented referral for follow up back to their general practitioners , and has resource implications for breast clinics .
To conclude , despite the limitations of an open design , these data suggest that patients suffering significant side effects on adjuvant tamoxifen should be given the opportunity to try an __AI__ , as in this study the majority had an improved level of hot flushes , quality of life and mood .
This trial highlights patient 's capacity and enthusiasm , if empowered with personal experiences , to share decisions with their clinicians and choose which drug best fits their lives , particularly trading off lower hot flushes for higher arthralgia .
This manoeuvre is likely to lead to a better quality of life for women receiving adjuvant hormone therapies , but will require greater resources for more frequent and more in-depth follow-up consultations .
