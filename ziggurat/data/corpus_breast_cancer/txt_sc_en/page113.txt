Although evidence that links meat consumption with cancers of the stomach , colorectum and pancreas is increasing , studies of meat consumption and breast cancer have produced more conflicting results .
A meta-analysis of 31 case-control and cohort studies published before 2003 found a 17% increase in risk associated with the highest category of meat intakes .
However , a pooled analysis of the raw data from eight prospective cohort studies from North America , Canada and Western Europe was unable to demonstrate such an association .
Certain evidence suggests an interaction between cooking methods and diet in breast cancer causation .
Studies , however , are few and inconsistent .
A case-control study of Chinese women in Shanghai found that the positive association with red-meat intake was primarily restricted to those who used deep-frying cooking methods , particularly among those who deep-fried foods to well-done suggesting an effect of heterocyclic amines or other carcinogens formed at high temperatures .
However , the Nurses Health nested case-control study found no increase in risk with cooking method or meat intake even for consumption of charred meat more than once a week in rapid acetylators .
Some of the inconsistency in findings may be owing to differences in definitions of total meat , red , and processed meats and in the derivation of the meat content of meat dishes .
Other inconsistencies may arise owing to biases , errors and the homogeneity of diet within individual population groups .
The __UKWCS__ , which was established in 1993 to investigate diet in relation to cancer and mortality from selected causes , is well placed to examine meat consumption and breast cancer risk , the subject of this paper .
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The __UKWCS__ , described previously , was formed from 500000 responders to a direct mail survey of the __WCRF__ after permission to carry out the baseline study was obtained from 174 local research ethics committees .
Seventy-five percent of the responders agreed to take part in a more detailed survey ; those eligible for inclusion were women , aged between 35 and 69 years at the completion date of the original mail survey .
The 35372 women who returned completed questionnaires formed the __UKWCS__ , this cohort being specifically designed to have a wide range of dietary intakes and patterns to increase the potential power to detect statistically significant associations between specific diets and disease ; 28% are self-reported vegetarians .
Baseline data were gathered between 1995 and 1998 using a 217 item postal __FFQ__ , developed from that of the __FFQ__ study .
This was validated in terms of nutrients , against a semi-weighed 4 day food diary .
Details of women fulfilling the eligibility criteria were submitted to the UK Office of National Statistics and subsequently flagged on the NHS central register .
Incident cancers and cause of death were coded according to the International Classification of Diseases 9 and 10. The investigation censor date was 31st October 2004 , with median follow-up of 8 years when a total of 1750 incident malignant cancer cases had been recorded , including 283 premenopausal and 395 postmenopausal breast cancers .
Menopausal status was based on answers to the baseline questionnaire regarding menstrual and obstetric history and the age at baseline .
Power calculations suggested 283 premenopausal breast cancer cases would give approximately 80% power to detect a relative risk of 1.4 comparing two levels of a binary exposure with equal numbers in each group ( P<0.05 ) , or more than 90% power for a relative risk of 1.5. In terms of postmenopausal breast cancer , 395 cases would give approximately 90% power to detect a relative risk of 1.4 ( P<0.05 ) .
Analysing the exposure as a continuous variable would provide even more power .
Meat consumption
For the purpose of the study , meat types and meat dishes were grouped into the following categories : red meat , poultry , offal and processed meat .
Total meat was the sum of these four categories .
Non-processed was the sum of red meat , poultry and offal .
Red meat consisted of beef , pork , lamb and other red meats included in mixed dishes , for example , meat lasagne , moussaka , ravioli and filled pasta with sauce ; poultry included roast chicken , chicken slices , bread crumbed chicken , chicken or turkey in a creamy sauce and chicken curry ; meats considered as processed were bacon , ham , corned beef , spam , luncheon meats , sausages , pies , pasties , sausage rolls , liver pate , salami and meat pizza ; offal ( organ meats ) existed as a single item on the __FFQ__ .
Daily intakes of each of the four main meat types ( red , poultry , offal and processed ) were calculated by summing the daily intakes of the individual food items within each meat type as described above .
Intakes of each item were determined by using the frequency categories to estimate the number of daily portions .
These were then converted into weights by referring to standard portion sizes for each food item ( Food Standards Agency , 2002 ) .
Intakes of each meat type were grouped into consumption categories of none , low , medium and high by classing zero intakes as non-consumers and dividing non-zero intakes into tertiles .
Consumption of offal tended to be more limited and naturally fell into the three categories none , low and high consumption only , where low consumption was defined as 2 g or less per day and high as over 2 g per day .
Statistical analysis
Exposures of interest were total meat consumption , non-processed vs processed meat consumption and consumption of different meat types .
Processed meat formed a separate category to be compared against non-processed meat .
Survival analyses were conducted in Stata version 9 using Cox regression weighted by the inverse of the probability of being sampled to take into account the large proportion of vegetarians in the cohort .
The time variable used in the survival analysis was time in the study ( person years ) , calculated as the time from the date the questionnaire was filled in until either a report of incident breast cancer , death or the censor date of the analysis , whichever came first .
Women with extremely high or low total energy intake ( more than 6000 kcal and less than 500 kcal ) were excluded , as were women with prevalent breast cancer .
Two models were developed .
Model 1 adjusted only for age ( continuous ) and energy intake by the residuals method ( split into quartiles ) .
Model 2 adjusted for age , energy intake , __BMI__ ( continuous ) , physical activity ( continuous ) , parity ( no children , 1-2 children , 3-4 children and 5+ children ) and combined fruit and vegetable consumption ( split into quartiles ) .
Smoking status , __HRT__ and oral contraceptive pill use were also included and all classed as present , past or never .
Additional confounders were included such as socioeconomic class ( professional and managerial , intermediate , and routine and manual ) , level of educational qualifications gained ( none beyond age 14 , O level , A level and degree level ) .
Fractional polynomials were used to fit a smooth curve to the relationship between breast cancer and total meat intake using Model 2.
As breast cancer may represent different diseases in the two menopause status groups , an initial analysis combined both groups , incorporating menopausal status as a confounder in the model .
As a test for interaction between meat consumption and menopausal status confirmed a potential modifying effect of menopausal status , we have treated pre- and postmenopausal women independently .
The proportional hazards assumption was checked using graphical methods of log-log curves and Schoenfeld goodness of fit tests , which confirmed the hazards were proportional .
Owing to the likelihood of differences in lifestyle characteristics between vegetarians and meat eaters in addition to the absence of the meat component within their diet , sensitivity analyses were undertaken excluding vegetarians .
The sensitivity of results to excluding women with any cancer incident within 1 year of entry to the study , and to the model building strategy was assessed .
Further analysis of sensitivity of results to the menopausal categorisation was carried out by excluding women aged 48-55 years whose menopausal status may have been ambiguous .
__HRT__ users ( past and present ) were also excluded in a sensitivity analysis .
RESULTS
Basic characteristics and meat consumption in the cohort
Characteristics of the 33725 women in the study are shown in Table 1. At baseline , the mean age was 52 years and the average __BMI__ 24.5 kg m-2 .
Cohort participants were relatively health conscious , with low rates of smoking ( 11% ) and alcohol consumption more than once per week ( 52% ) .
Most did not use full-fat milk ( 28383 , 88% ) , and a large proportion reported taking dietary supplements ( 18561 , 58% ) .
Meat eaters account for a higher percentage of present __HRT__ users than vegetarians , although it must be taken into consideration that vegetarians tend to be younger and therefore less likely to be using __HRT__ .
In general , the cohort is well educated and middle class where 8784 ( 27% ) had been educated to degree level and 20879 ( 63% ) worked in professional or managerial positions .
More detail regarding the cohort women has been provided previously .
Table 1 shows that non-meat consumers were younger , more physically active , and had a lower mean __BMI__ than consumers .
High meat consumers were more likely to be smokers , had the highest total energy intake , highest mean __BMI__ , highest proportion with no education beyond age 14 and lowest proportion employed in professional or managerial occupations .
Medium meat consumers were most likely to be low fruit and vegetable consumers ( less than 400 g daily ) .
The lowest energy intake was seen in the group with low meat consumption .
Meat consumption and breast cancer
The initial analysis combining both pre- and postmenopausal women to test for effect modification by menopausal status showed several significant interactions .
Indeed , when independent analyses were conducted for each menopausal status , trends were considerably different .
The associations between meat consumption and premenopausal breast cancer are presented in Table 3 for both Model 1 and Model 2. Use of the complex model showed risk of breast cancer to increase with consumption of total meat , __HR__ =1.20 ( 95% CI : 0.86-1.68 ) for high consumers vs non-consumers .
The estimated relative risk for an increase in total meat consumption of 50 g day-1 ( approximately half a portion ) was 1.12 ( 95% CI : 1.02-1.23 , Ptrend=0.02 ) .
Non-processed meat consumption was positively associated with risk , HR=1.20 ( 95% CI : 0.86-1.68 ) for high consumers vs non-consumers with a relative risk per 50 g day-1 of 1.13 ( 95% CI : 1.01-1.26 , Ptrend=0.03 ) .
The association with processed meat was not statistically significant although the risk in high consumers was similar to that observed in non-processed meat .
The borderline non-significant association with red meat consumption tended to show the largest effect sizes of all meat types , HR=1.32 ( 95% CI : 0.93-1.88 ) for high consumption vs the reference category with relative risk per 50 g day-1 of 1.13 ( 95% CI : 0.99-1.29 , Ptrend=0.08 ) .
In postmenopausal women , slight positive trends were observed across the low , medium and high meat categories with a more marked difference between those not consuming meat and those that do .
However , splitting the meat categories into more groups by dividing the low consumers into low and very low consumers strengthened the dose response relationship with meat consumption .
There was a tendency for the point estimates to be somewhat larger in postmenopausal than in premenopausal women ( using Model 2 ) , as shown in Table 4. Total meat intake was positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer , HR=1.63 ( 95% CI : 1.10-2.30 ) for high consumption vs the reference category , and when treated as a continuous variable , resulted in a significant linear trend and relative risk per 50 g day-1 of 1.10 ( 95% CI : 1.01-1.20 , Ptrend =0.02 ) .
Relationships between both processed meat and red meat and postmenopausal breast cancer were also significant .
Risks for the three meat types were similar when considering HRs of the categorical analysis , however , fitting meat in the model as a continuous predictor resulted in a much stronger relationship with processed meat , giving a relative risk per 50 g day-1 of 1.64 ( 95% CI : 1.09-2.27 , Ptrend=0.003 ) .
Hazard ratios in the highest meat consumption category for Model 1 in premenopausal women were slightly lower than for Model 2 for all meat types with the exception of offal ( total meat : Model 1 HR=1.16 , Model 2 HR=1.20 ) .
Tests for trend were more significant in Model 2. The opposite is true for postmenopausal risk where HRs are lowered in the refined model and P-values become less significant with greater adjustments .
Figure 1 presents the fitted curve from fractional polynomials for total meat intake showing similar increasing risk with increasing total meat intake for both pre- and postmenopausal women , apart from premenopausal women with low meat intake who appear at lower risk than vegetarians .
In the sensitivity results excluding vegetarians , estimates were broadly similar and conclusions unchanged , emphasising a dose response across the consumption categories of meat in both pre- and postmenopausal women .
Sensitivity analyses for ambiguous menopausal status and women with cancer within 1 year of entry did not substantially alter HRs or overall trends .
The links between meat consumption , cooking methods ( grilling , frying and casseroling of meat ) and risk were investigated by considering interactions within Model 2 ; there was no evidence of changes in risk .
Excluding __HRT__ users from the analysis of postmenopausal women appeared to strengthen the relationship with breast cancer .
DISCUSSION
The __UKWCS__ is one of the largest cohorts investigating diet and cancer in women in the UK .
It was designed to include participants with a wide range of dietary exposures to optimise comparisons between different levels of meat intake , as proposed previously .
In our analysis , significant increased risks of incident premenopausal breast cancer in relation to increased consumption of total meat and non-processed meat were observed .
Borderline non-significant associations with red meat were also seen .
We found positive associations between postmenopausal breast cancer and total meat , processed meat and red meat consumption .
Relationships between both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer and total and red meat consumption confirm findings of a case control study among Chinese women in Shanghai where positive associations were observed in pre- and postmenopausal breast cancers combined .
Although pre- and postmenopausal women were also considered separately , the full data were not shown .
Positive associations among those who usually deep-fried red meat until well done , were found in both groups , although statistically significant only in premenopausal women .
The association with red meat intake and both pre- and postmenopausal breast cancer may be due to a combination of nutritionally related factors , such as content of fat , protein and iron , and / or meat preparation ( eg cooking or preserving methods ) .
A comparison of high consumer HRs for all meat types investigated showed that high consumers of red meat are most at risk of premenopausal breast cancer when compared with non-consumers ( HR=1.32 , 95% CI : 0.93-1.88 ) .
The association found between non-processed meat ( red meat , poultry and offal ) could also be caused by the red meat component within the non-processed meat category .
Results of a large case-control study ( 10149 cases and 7990 controls ) in northern Italy between 1983 and 1996 also found significant positive associations of breast cancer ( combined analysis of pre- and post menopausal women ) with red meat consumption .
In addition , a meta-analysis of 12 case-control and five cohort studies published between 1966 and 1993 found increased risks of breast cancer ( combined pre- and postmenopausal ) in high consumers , the association with red meat ( RR=1.54 , 95% CI : 1.31-1.82 ) being stronger than that observed for total meat .
However , a pooled analysis of eight previous cohort studies has shown no significant association between consumption of total meat , red meat or white meat and risk of breast cancer in both combined and separate analyses of pre- and postmenopausal women .
The pooled analysis was not able to correct for measurement error and there were considerable differences in questionnaire design between studies limiting the power of specific food analyses .
Also , meat-cooking practices could not be taken into account .
Previous studies have tended to find inverse relationships with consumption of poultry and have generally been statistically non-significant .
Our findings do not provide strong evidence of an association with poultry intake and breast cancer in either pre- or postmenopausal women .
However , another study showed statistically significant inverse trends between consumption of poultry and postmenopausal breast cancer .
One study found that risks were increased when chicken was consumed with skin suggesting that fat rather than muscle meat may be the cause .
Other studies have suggested a link between fat and breast cancer .
Although HRs for pre menopausal breast cancer indicate a positive association with meat intake , low consumers are at less risk than vegetarians .
Low meat consumers also had the lowest energy and fat intakes , but including the percentage of energy from fat as a confounder and also calculated using the residuals method did not significantly modify the risk estimates .
Vegetarians possess other characteristics other than not consuming meat and these may influence the association with risk in some way .
Although we adjusted for characteristics known to be represented differently in meat eaters and vegetarians and performed various sensitivity analyses with the exclusion of the vegetarian group , some residual confounding may remain .
Genetic factors only account for a small proportion of breast cancers ( approximately 5-10% ) .
The __UKWCS__ are expected to have a higher proportion than this as family history of breast cancer may have encouraged them to become __WCRF__ supporters .
In addition , some may have taken up a vegetarian diet in the belief that it is protective against breast cancer .
However , if these women are also genetically predisposed to breast cancer , then the chances of developing breast cancer are increased .
This is more likely among the premenopausal women because genetic causes tend to lead to early onset of breast cancer .
This could explain why , in the premenopausal women , vegetarians have a higher risk than others .
Risks for pre- and postmenopausal women were examined separately , based on variability in some risk factors and because breast cancer may represent different diseases in these groups .
Also , mean intakes of certain meats were found to differ significantly between the two menopausal groups .
In addition , after the menopause , increased deposition of adipose tissue , the major site for oestrogen synthesis , will tend to elevate the level of endogenous oestrogens .
The association between intake of carcinogens from foods cooked at high temperature and breast cancer risk may be modified by oestrogens and oestrogen-related factors .
Other analysis has found a difference in impact of dietary fibre on risk of breast cancer between pre- and postmenopausal women .
There are several mechanisms whereby meat intake may contribute to breast cancer risk .
Meat and in particular processed meats can be a rich source of saturated fat .
Although effect on mammary carcinogenesis has been shown in animals , its human relevance is controversial .
A review of prospective studies has shown that dietary fat reduction can lower serum oestradiol levels .
Many established risk factors are linked to oestrogens such as early menarche , late menopause and obesity in postmenopausal women .
Other mechanisms related to the formation of heterocyclic amines during cooking or nitroso compounds found in processed meat may be altered by inherited polymorphisms such as the rapid variant of N-acetyltransferase 2 .
Red meat also contains high biological-value protein and important micronutrients , all of which are essential for good health throughout life .
In postmenopausal women , the largest effects were with processed meat and this was statistically significant , HR=1.64 ( 95% CI : 1.14-2.37 ) for high vs non-consumers with relative risk per 50 g day-1 of 1.64 ( 95% CI : 1.19-2.27 , Ptrend=0.003 ) .
Risks were increased by almost 50% for even low consumers of processed meat .
A case-control study in a subcohort of the Nurses Health Study ( 466 cases ) supports this , breast cancer ( combined pre- and postmenopausal ) being 40% more likely in women consuming more than 0.07 portions of bacon daily in comparison with non-consumers .
Although trends were statistically non-significant , non-processed meat and poultry were both positively associated with postmenopausal breast cancer .
Differences in outcome trends for pre- and postmenopausal women may be owing to the fact that oestrogen metabolism pathways differ according to menopausal status .
If meat influences breast cancer by affecting oestrogen metabolism , the effect may be relatively more important among women with lower levels of circulating oestrogens .
The strength of this study was the wide range of meat intake within the cohort which reduces measurement error .
Previous studies have been limited in terms of the FFQs used which may not have been designed to capture specific food groups in sufficient detail .
An analysis of EPIC-Norfolk data concluded that dietary measurement error through the use of their __FFQ__ may explain the absence of a significant association with dietary fat and breast cancer risk as well as some of the previously reported inconsistencies on meat .
In conclusion , women generally consuming most total meat , red and processed meat were at the highest increased risk compared with non-meat consumers , though red and processed meat were only statistically significant postmenopausally .
Effect sizes were smaller in non-processed meat and only statistically significant in premenopausal women .
There were no statistically significant linear associations with consumption of poultry or offal in either pre- or postmenopausal women .
This study indicates relationships with certain meats and breast cancer in both pre- and postmenopausal women and merits further investigation in a larger study .
