Introduction
The national mortality rates from breast cancer in both the USA and the UK fell significantly between 1990 and 2000.1 These reductions are probably due to several factors , including the implementation of breast cancer screening and the greater use of systemic adjuvant therapies in __EBC__ .
Systemic adjuvant therapy is considered for most patients with node positive disease , but the selection of which node negative patients should be offered systemic adjuvant therapy can be difficult .
In __EBC__ ( breast cancer restricted to the breast , with or without involvement of the ipsilateral axillary lymph nodes ) the risk of recurrence is used to determine whether a patient requires systemic adjuvant therapy .
The risk of recurrence is usually estimated by assessment of established prognostic factors : tumour size , tumour grade , the presence of axillary lymph node involvement , and , to a lesser extent , tumour hormone receptor status .
Of these prognostic factors , the strongest is the presence ( and the extent ) of axillary lymph node involvement .
In node negative __EBC__ , the most important prognostic factors are the size and grade of the tumour , although lymphovascular invasion is also important.2 In Europe , the __NPI__ 3 , which combines tumour size , tumour grade and lymph node status , is widely used and has been extensively validated and recently , has been shown to perform well in patients treated with more modern treatments6 .
It can also be used as a continuous index to provide individual prognostication.7 In North America many oncologists use Adjuvant!8 , a web-based tool that predicts 10 year __EBC__ outcomes with and without systemic adjuvant therapy .
The algorithm uses population based data from the USA and its applicability in Europe has been questioned , but its value has been confirmed in a large patient cohort from Canada.9 As we understand more about the basic biology of breast cancer , further prognostic factors are being identified by a variety of techniques .
Many of these factors , such as the tumour HE__IHC__ or in situ hybridisation techniques but recently , other molecular approaches and systems of classification and prediction of prognosis have been described.10 However , all of the factors used to estimate the risk of recurrence reflect how aggressive the tumour is , either directly or indirectly and thus , these factors are usually inter-related .
Therefore , an important property of any new potential factor should be that it provides independent prognostic information .
This is usually assessed by a Cox multivariate analysis .
Underpinning many of the currently available prognostic factors is how rapidly the tumour is growing , i.e. its proliferation rate .
In recent years , several new proliferation markers have been reported .
Although some appear useful , we do not know whether they provide independent prognostic information , and in particular , whether they provide additional information over and above traditional prognostic factors .
The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the literature relating proliferation markers ( Ki-67 , MI , PCNA and LI ( including thymidine labelling index and bromodeoxyuridine labelling index ) to survival in __EBC__ and , where possible , to carry out a quantitative summary of the published data ( meta-analysis ) .
Methods
In September 2004 , we selected the following proliferation markers to be included in the review : Ki-67 ( including MIB1 ) , MI ( including mitotic count , mitotic figure count and mitotic activity index ) , PCNA and LI ( including thymidine labelling index and bromodeoxyuridine labelling index ) .
Search strategy and selection criteria
Data were identified by searches of PubMed using the search terms " breast cancer " and the names of the individual proliferation markers ( including the synonyms listed above ) .
Only papers published in English between January 1995 and September 2004 that included at least 100 patients with __EBC__ and that specified a survival outcome were included .
A shortlist of potentially suitable studies for each marker was established and copies of the publications obtained .
Where it was obvious that the data were reported on more than one occasion , we excluded the duplicate report .
For Ki-67 , 43 studies ( 15,790 patients ) were selected from a shortlist of 126 .
For MI , 20 studies ( 7021 patients ) were selected from a shortlist of 46. For PCNA , 11 studies ( 2677 patients ) were selected from a shortlist of 31. Finally , for LI , 11 studies ( 7337 patients ) were selected from a shortlist of 23.
Analysis of studies
Data from the studies selected were entered onto a database containing the following fields : author , total number of patients in the study , number of node negative patients , number of node positive patients , number of premenopausal patients ( or patients aged less than 50 years ) , number of postmenopausal patients ( or patients aged 50 years or older ) , marker ( s ) analysed , antibody used for detection ( where applicable ) , laboratory technique ( s ) and cut off values ( where applicable ) , percentage that received adjuvant systemic therapy , and median follow-up .
__OS__ and __OS__ were recorded , where available , and separated according to whether they had been analysed by univariate or multivariate analysis .
__DSS__ was included under __OS__ and __DSS__ and __DSS__ were included under __DFS__ .
For both __OS__ and __DFS__ the following were recorded ( where available ) :__HR__ , the p value for the factor , whether the p value was exact or not and whether survival had been analysed by univariate and / or multivariate analysis .
If multivariate analysis had been performed , other factors included in the model were also recorded .
For the meta-analysis , only those studies that provided an __HR__ for the effect of the marker on either __OS__ or __DFS__ , either from a univariate and / or multivariate analysis were included .
Where a __HR__ was available but 95% __CI__ were not specified , these were calculated using the p values , if available .
Limitations
Considerable variation in both the nature and the quality of the reporting of studies was noted .
For example , usually , follow-up was reported as median follow-up ( in months ) .
However , if only mean follow-up was reported then this was used .
No attempt was made to contact the authors of the studies to provide updated information on survival .
Statistical analysis
Pooled estimates of the HRs were obtained using both fixed-effect and random-effect meta-analyses using the inverse-variance weighting method.11 Statistical heterogeneity between studies was assessed using the among-study variance ( s2 ) and the statistic I2.12 A funnel plot and Egger 's regression test for funnel plot asymmetry13 were used to look for the presence of a small-study effect that might be due to publication bias .
Publication bias is caused by the fact that studies with statistically significant findings are more likely to be published than those with a null result .
The " trim and fill " method14 was implemented to explore the possible nature of studies " missed " in the review and to attempt to estimate the " true " relative risk estimate accounting for publication bias .
All these analyses were undertaken using Stata version 9 ( Stata Corporation , College Station , TX , USA ) .

Discussion
Although there have been previous reviews of proliferation markers , immunohistochemical markers and molecular markers in breast cancer , including a meta-analysis of Ki-67 in EBC89 , to our knowledge , this is the first comprehensive evaluation of all published data on Ki-67 , MI , PCNA and LI in __EBC__ to include a quantitative summary ( meta-analysis ) .
The studies analysed used different eligibility criteria , study design , measurement of markers and , in some cases , classified markers into different ranges .
Although this caused some difficulties in evaluation , this strengthens the findings of this review and meta-analysis and indicates that our findings are robust .
However , publication bias remains a problem in any such analysis and evidence of publication bias was indeed found .
Where appropriate , we have adjusted the data to allow for " missing " studies using the " trim and fill " method and the strong associations found persisted , indicating that the findings are likely to be true .
As all of these markers are measures of proliferation , they are likely to be correlated with each other .
Consequently , their effects on survival are unlikely to be completely independent of each other .
However , few of the studies included data on more than one marker , and it is not possible to identify which of the markers is the most important .
Furthermore , whether these markers provide additional information that will help predict clinical outcome over and above the currently used prognostic indices ( the __NPI__ and Adjuvant! ) , is not clear .
A previous review has suggested that the independent prognostic significance of Ki-67 is only modest , but that Ki-67 is useful as a marker of a good chance of response to medical therapy.88 Ki-67 positivity has also been found to be associated with a higher risk of relapse in both node positive and node negative EBC89 and may be useful in predicting the incidence of lymph node metastasis.90 However , it has also been noted that Ki-67 analysis may occasionally misclassify some patients into an incorrect prognostic category.91 Most of the studies included in this report carried out some form of multivariate analysis and the estimates of the HRs from the pooled multivariate adjusted estimates suggest that these markers may prove useful .
However , each study adjusted for different co-variates and further large studies with data on multiple markers are required to confirm their relative contribution to prognostication .
Currently , there is considerable interest in gene profiling and the use of genetic signatures to estimate prognosis in __EBC__ , predominantly to define which patients require systemic adjuvant therapies .
At present , gene profiling remains a research tool and is not used routinely .
It is apparent that although many of the gene expression signatures reported to be of prognostic significance analyse different genes , most of the genes analysed are associated with cell cycle progression and proliferation.92 Moreover , genetic profiling does not necessarily provide superior prognostic information than the __NPI__ or Adjuvant!. Genetic signatures are probably indicators of the proliferative ability of a tumour and , therefore , are surrogate proliferation markers92 , underscoring the importance of our meta-analysis .
In general , genetic profiling appears most useful as a prognostic tool in ER positive tumours and although prognostic signatures assign most ER negative tumours to a high-risk category , a subgroup of ER negative tumours associated with a better prognosis was reported , recently.95
Large studies with characterisation of multiple proliferation markers are urgently needed to identify those proliferation markers that contribute most to clinical outcome in __EBC__ .
To date , such studies have not been performed and , to our knowledge , BCL2 ( an anti-apoptotic protein ) is the sole immunohistochemical marker that has been shown to be independent of the NPI.96 The challenge is to conduct similar studies with proliferation markers in large series of patients where current prognostic index information , such as the __NPI__ or Adjuvant ! is available , so that the added value of these markers can be demonstrated .
Conclusions
Ki-67 , MI , PCNA , and LI are associated with worse survival outcomes in __EBC__ .
It is not possible to identify which of the markers is the most important .
Whether these proliferation markers provide additional prognostic information over and above prognostic indices such as the __NPI__ and Adjuvant! , remains unclear and will require large prospective studies .
