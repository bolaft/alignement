Introduction
Central tumour of the breast has traditionally been an indication for mastectomy .
__BCS__ has been attempted by way of wedge excision of the __BCS__ , which may result in an oncologically safe option but usually leads to unacceptable cosmetic appearance , with loss of both volume and projection of the breast.
Oncoplastic __BCS__ , a term coined by Audretsch,3 aims to achieve tumour free excision margins without cosmetic deformity .
Techniques include transferring adjacent breast parenchyma ( local dermoglandular flaps ) for moderate volume replacement.1 For larger defects , breast reduction mammapla__LDMF__ is a good volume replacement technique that can compensate for over 25% of lost breast volume.
We present two cases of breast carcinoma involving the __NAC__ , that were treated with breast conservation therapy and immediate breast reconstruction .
These two case reports illustrate the role of mammaplasties and LDMF in Oncoplastic __BCS__ of carcinomas involving the nipple .
Methods
Case 1
Fifty-four-year old female presents with 10 weeks history of superficial lump 3 o'clock of the left areola .
Mammogram and ultrasound scan were benign ( X3 , U1 ) but core biopsy under LA showed Grade I intraductal invasive carcinoma .
All surgical options were offered .
Surgery was performed within 2.5 weeks : left __WLE__ and __WLE__ with immediate __WLE__ reconstruction to replace volume loss .
A small overlying skin paddle from the flap was used to substitute the __NAC__ .
Histology sho__NST__ and oestrogen receptor ( ER ) positive .
The resection margins were : superior 13 mm , medial 15 mm , inferior 5 mm , lateral 2.5 mm , posterior 20 mm and anterior 4 mm .
Anteriorly ( skin and nipple ) , the carcinoma infiltrated the stroma just under the nipple epidermis but did not actually involve the epidermis .
Cavity shaves were taken ( deep , lateral , superior , medial and inferior ) smallest measuring 30×25×5 mm3 and sent intraoperatively for frozen section and showed no evidence of carcionma in situ or malignancy .
Further cavity shaves were also free of disease .
The minimum was at the lateral resection margin at 7.5 mm ( initial resection plus cavity shave ) .
Adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal manipulation followed .
The __WLE__ specimen weighed 58 g .
Surgery time was 3.5 h .
In-hospital stay was 5 days .
The patient has been followed up for 2.5 years and is disease free .
Initially , the patient had a custom made left nipple prosthesis , followed by a left nipple reconstruction and tattooing .
Case 2
Thirty-nine-year old Caucasian female presents with 18 months history of left nipple eczema .
Mammogram and USS negative ( X1 , U1 ) but core biopsy under LA showed a Grade II intraductal invasive carcinoma .
All surgical options were offered .
Left __BCS__ was performed 3 weeks later as an oncoplastic inferior pedicle breast reduction and left __ALNC__ .
A skin paddle from the primary pedicle was used to substitute the __NAC__ .
Wide excision of the carcinoma was achieved , with the __WLE__ specimen weighing 596 g .
The total breast reduction specimen weight was 1095 g on the left breast and 850 g on the right .
Final pathology showed a 31 mm Grade II __NST__ with two foci of Pagets disease , __LN__ positive ( 5 / 9 ) and ER positive .
The resection margins were 5 mm medially , 16 mm superiorly , 15 mm from deep margin , 2 mm laterally and 7 mm inferiorly .
The medial ( 100×65×30 mm3 ) lateral ( 100×85×50 mm3 ) and inferior ( 80×80×10 mm3 ) shaves were free of disease .
Making the minimum resection margin at 52 mm .
The surgery time was 3 h and the in-hospital stay 4 days .
The patient has been followed up for View the MathML source years .
Adjuvant chemotherapy , radiotherapy and hormonal manipulation were indicated .
Discussion
The role of __BCS__ is being extended by oncoplastic techniques such as reduction mammaplasty and LDMF reconstruction .
They allow increasingly wider excisions to gain local control of breast carcinoma .
One study with __WLE__ and LDMF reconstruction has shown a reduction of excision margin positivity from 37% to 10%.5 In another study , using bilateral reduction mammaplasty , the 5 year actuarial local recurrence rate was 9.4% , with mean specimen weight of 222 g from the breast with the cancer6 ( 596 g in our case ) .
These two reported cases support our approach in the planning and use of oncoplastic techniques in the treatment of breast carcinomas involving the __NAC__ .
The first case represents a type of patient suitable for __BCS__ who would otherwise have a poor cosmetic outcome with wedge excision of the __NAC__ .
The LDMF was performed in one stage , using frozen sections to confirm clear excision margins and closing the wound primarily .
The intraoperative frozen section was used in order not to waste the LDMF , since a __BCS__ failure could otherwise limit futher __BCS__ .
In our first case , several factors influenced the decision for __BCS__ over mastectomy with LD reconstruction .
The patient would have needed an implant if she had opted for a mastectomy with LD reconstruction , as her breast tissue was insufficient for pure autologus breast reconstruction .
An implant insertion would add a futher factor for future revision surgery , given the youth of the patient and the wear and tear on the implant over time .
The risk of ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence was considered low , as it was a 10 mm unifocal Grade I tumour .
Finally , all options were clearly offered to the patient , who chose __BCS__ over mastectomy .
Suitable patients for this type of surgery are those with tumours involving the __NAC__ that meet the same criteria as for invasive cancer anywhere else in the breast where __BCS__ would be indicated .
Those with T3 - T4 disease will be excluded .
In cases without __NAC__ involvement , our standard protocol two-stage procedure starts with a __WLE__ , with excision margins checked by histology , followed by axillary node staging , with LDMF reconstruction .
We accept resection margins of 5 - 10 mm .
The second patient represents women with marked macrommastia who will benefit from improved quality of life following reduction mammaplasty .
It is important to note the reduced morbidity inherent in giving radiotherapy to a patient group with large breasts.9 In this particular case , an inferior pedicle was used to fill the __WLE__ defect , with a skin paddle from the pedicle forming the new __NAC.__ Alternatively , a closing wedge inverted T mammaplasty could have been used for this patient .
No significant complications occurred in our cases and therefore adjuvant treatment was not delayed .
Pre-operative radiotherapy or chemotherapy are not generally advocated before oncoplastic surgery , because of their associated higher risk of post-operative complications and poor cosmesis.
4. Conclusion
In our experience , oncoplastic procedures enable local excision of breast carcinomas involving the __NAC__ , with enhanced cosmetic results and a low complication rate .
The primary aim of __BCS__ is oncological , with cosmetic appearance secondary , but evidence points to superior quality of life for the patient than with mastectomy.10 In combination with adjuvant radiotherapy , oncoplastic surgery ultimately reduces the need for mastectomy in this group of patients .
Current evidence suggests that ipsilateral breast tumour recurrence for __BCS__ is acceptable at 8.7% at 10 years.11
Further follow-up is required to determine whether mastectomy rate is reduced without increase in local recurrence , but the results we have obtained so far have encouraged us to integrate oncoplastic breast surgery into our surgical protocol .
