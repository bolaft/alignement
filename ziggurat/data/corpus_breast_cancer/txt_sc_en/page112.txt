Angiogenesis , the formation of new blood vessels , and lymphangiogenesis , the formation of new lymphatics , are complex processes in which different signalling systems work together ; the main system being the __VEGF__ family of proteins and the associated receptors .
This system is composed of a family of glycoprotein growth factors ; VEGF-A , -B , -C , -D , -E and the __PLGF__ .
They bind selectively , with different affinities to three receptors that belong to the superfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases ; VEGFR-1 , -2 and -3 .
Both VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are expressed on the surface of __BECs__ .
Vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor-3 is expressed throughout both blood and lymphatic vasculature during embryological development and in tumour tissues , however in normal adult tissues it is restricted to __LECs__ .
Vascular endothelial cell growth factor-A , a multifunctional cytokine secreted by a large variety of cells , is known to play an essential role in vasculogenesis and angiogenesis .
During transcription , it undergoes alternative splicing , yielding multiple mature glycoprotein i__ECs__ .
Expression of VEGF-A has been found to be upregulated and suggested to be associated with progression of certain types of human tumours such as lung , eosophageal and colorectal cancers ( Des Guetz et al , 2006 ) .
Studies on human breast cancer reported a significant relationship between high expression of VEGF-A and tumours with higher proliferation rate , negative oestrogen receptor status and poor prognosis .
The role of VEGF-A as a potent angiogenic factor in malignant tumours is well established , but it has long been thought that it had no influence upon lymphangiogenesis .
It has recently been reported , however , that VEGF-A can induce lymphangiogenesis as well as angiogenesis .
The relationship between the expression of VEGF-A and lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer has not been studied and is a component of the current study .
VEGF-C and -D have potent lymphangiogenic functions through stimulation of VEGFR-3 on the surface of __LECs__ .
They are produced in pro-prepeptide dimers that undergo proteolysis in the __ECM__ to a mature form that has much higher affinity to VEGFR-3 , inducing lymphangiogenesis , but can also bind VEGFR-2 , inducing angiogenesis .
Overexpression of VEGF-C and -D in experimental tumour models has been found to be significantly associated with the formation of new lymphatics ( Skobe et al , 2001 ; Stacker et al , 2001 ; Von Marschall et al , 2005 ) , however , their eff__LN__ status and prognosis and others no relationships .
The mainstay of assessment of tumour vascularity has been counting the number of immunohistochemically identified microvessels in vascular hot spots , known as the __MVD__ , using vascular markers such as factor VIII-related antigen , CD34 and CD31 , with a recent review recommending procedures that should be followed for the assessment of __MVD__ in breast cancer .
The assessment of lymphatic characteristics in malignant tumours has historically been difficult owing to the lack of availability of lymphatic-specific markers .
Such markers have recently been characterised and become commercially available .
Markers include podoplanin , D2-40 , LYVE-1 and Prox-1 .
The count of positively stained vessels per tumour area , __LVD__ , has been used to assess lymphangiogenic characteristics in tumour specimens .
High __MVD__ and high __LVD__ in breast cancer have been reported to be associated with more aggressive tumour behaviour and poorer survival .
Although a number of studies have examined the relationship between the expression of each of the VEGFs with patient prognosis , angiogenic and lymphangiogenic characteristics in breast cancer , examination of the expression of all three , together , in a well-characterised series of breast cancers with long-term follow-up has not been conducted .
The aims of the current study were to : ( a ) investigate the expression of VEGF-A , -C and -D in human breast cancer via immunohistochemistry , ( b ) examine the tumour lymphatic and vascular characteristics by counting lymph vessels / area to determine __LVD__ and counting blood vessels via the Chalkley method to assess __MVD__ and ( c ) conduct correlations between expression of the growth factors in relation to patient clinicopathological data , survival , lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis to examine the role that they play in the regulation of such processes and in the progression of breast cancer .
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Patients and tissue samples
One hundred and seventy-seven paraffin-embedded archival specimens of primary invasive breast cancer were retrieved from the Department of Histopathology , Nottingham University Hospitals , City Hospital Campus .
The median age of patients at time of diagnosis was 57 years ( range 32-70 years ) .
Fifty-one patients ( 28.2% ) were younger than 50 years .
Sixty-five ( 36.7% ) of the specimens were <1.5 cm .
At the time of primary diagnosis , 52 ( 29.4% ) patients had positive LNs .
Most of the tumours were stage I ( n=121 , 68.4% ) and stage II ( n=43 , 24.3% ) disease .
Complete clinical follow-up information was available for all 177 patients , with ethical approval obtained for analysis from Nottingham Local Research Ethics Committee ( REC C2020313 ) .
The median follow-up period was 96 months .
Forty-one patients developed regional recurrence by the time of the last follow-up and 16 patients died from breast cancer .
Immunohistochemistry
Staining with two lymphatic markers , D2-40 ( SIGNET , 730-16 ) and podoplanin was carried out on paraffin-embedded blocks of tonsil , __LN__ and breast cancer tissues .
Recently , however , Schacht_et_al found that D2-40 and podoplanin detect the same protein on __LECs__ .
As both markers showed the same intensity of staining , and the same pattern , either can be used to generate the same results .
A representative , paraffin-embedded section from each specimen was stained with Podoplanin ( polyclonal Ab , AngioBio , CA , USA , 11-003 , 1 : 100 dilution ) , CD34 ( polyclonal Ab , SEROTEC , Oxford , UK , MCAP547 , 1 : 500 dilution ) , VEGF-A ( monoclonal Ab , LAB VISION , CA , USA , RM-9128-S , 1 : 100 dilution ) , VEGF-C ( polyclonal Ab , ZYMED , CA , USA , 18-2255 , 1 : 75 dilution ) and VEGF-D ( monoclonal Ab , R&D , Abingdon , UK , MAB286 in 1 : 400 dilution ) .
Briefly , 4-mum-thick sections were deparaffinised with xylene and rehydrated .
Antigen retrieval for CD34 , VEGF-A , -C and -D was achieved by incubating sections in 0.01 mol l-1 sodium citrate buffer ( pH 6.0 ) in a 800 W microwave for 20 min ; 10 min at 800 W then 10 min at 100 W. Podoplanin did not require antigen retrieval .
Endogenous hydrogen peroxidase ( H2O2 ) reactivity was blocked with 3% H2O2 .
Nonspecific reactions were blocked by use of normal swine serum for 20 min .
Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature for all primary antibodies except for VEGF-D that was incubated overnight at 4°C .
After washing , sections were treated with commercial biotinylated secondary anti-immunoglobulin , followed by avidin coupled to biotinylated horseradish peroxidase , at room temperature , according to the manufacturer 's instructions using streptABC kit ( StreptABComplex / HRP Duet , Mouse / Rabbit kit , DAKO Corporation , Denmark , K0492 ) .
Immunohistochemical reactions were developed with 3,3 diaminobenzidine as the chromogenic peroxidase substrate ( DAKO , K3468 ) .
Sections were then counterstained with Myer 's haematoxylein , dehydrated , fixed in xylene and mounted with DPX .
Sections from placenta were used as a positive control , for VEGFs and CD34 , and sections from __LN__ were used for podoplanin .
For negative controls , sections were stained using the same procedure after omitting primary antibody .
Evaluation of growth factor expression
Expression of VEGF-A , -C and -D was assessed semiquantitatively using an immunohistochemical score ( H score ) .
Staining intensity was given four grades : none ( 0 ) , weak ( 1 ) , moderate ( 2 ) and strong ( 3 ) .
H score was calculated by multiplying the percentage of positive carcinoma cells by the staining intensity , this gave an H score ranging from 0 to 300 .
The median of the score was selected as the cutoff level according to which tumours were categorised into low- and high-expressing tumours .
Median values were 160 for VEGF-A , 140 for VEGF-C and 130 for VEGF-D .
This method , in selecting an appropriate cutoff level , has been used in previous studies .
Assessment of __LVD__
The commonly used method for assessment of density of lymph vessels in tumour has been counting the number of immunohistochemically identified lymphatics in the most vascularised tumour areas ; hot spots .
In the present study , a modified procedure was used , where __LVD__ was assessed by counting all lymph vessels in the whole tumour section , using 100 magnification with a surface area of 3.46 mm2 .
Although easier to use the 200 magnification to assess __LVD__ , the strong staining of lymphatics allowed easy recognition of vessels at 100 , especially when examining the whole tumour section .
The sum of lymph vessels was divided by the sum of the surface area of all counted fields to adjust __LVD__ per mm2 .
Lymph vessel density was presented as number of lymph vessels per mm2 .
Although more labour intensive , such methodology allows a more accurate assessment of lymphatic density .
The distribution of lymphatics and prevalence of lymphovascular invasion will be the focus of a separate report .
Assessment of __MVD__
Sections stained with CD34 were used for the evaluation of __MVD__ using the Chalkley counting method .
Each section was first scanned at low-power magnification ( 40 ) to select the most vascularised areas ; three hot spots were selected .
Two authors first examined 10% of specimens to agree on which fields to be used as hot spots .
A 25 point Chalkley eyepiece graticule was applied to each hot spot and oriented to permit the maximum number of points to hit on , or within the areas of immunohistochemically highlighted microvessel using 200 magnification .
A Chalkley count for an individual tumour was taken as the mean value of the three graticule counts .
For assessment of __LVD__ , __MVD__ and expression of VEGFs , a second investigator also blinded to the patients clinical characteristics and survival data , independently assessed 20% of sections .
A kappa>0.90 was obtained , indicating a very good correlation between observers .
Statistical analysis
Four levels of statistics were performed using SPSS for windows , version 13 : ( 1 ) Mann-Whitney tests were conducted to compare means of __LVD__ and __MVD__ ( as a continuous data ) between different clinicopathological groups and ( 2 ) specimens were divided into two categories according to the median values of __LVD__ and __MVD__ .
The association betwe__DFI__ and __DFI__ was accomplished using the Kaplan-Meier method and the statistical significance of differences in the cumulative survival curves between groups was evaluated by the long-rank test .
Multivariate survival analysis was performed using the Cox 's proportional hazard method and ( 4 ) the Kappa ( kappa ) agreement test was used to assess agreement between observers .
All statistical analyses were two sided with significance defined as P<0.05 .
RESULTS
Expression of VEGFs
Expression of all three VEGFs showed a positive cytoplasmic staining in the breast cancer cells , with granular and heterogeneous staining in some specimens .
Positive staining for VEGF-A was detected in the normal mammary epithelial cells adjacent to tumour , in the __ECs__ and in the tumour-associated macrophages .
Seventy-seven ( 40% ) specimens of breast carcinomas showed high expression of VEGF-A , with stronger staining intensity found in the invasive component of the tumour and vascular emboli .
In many specimens , the staining intensity was heterogeneous among tumour areas .
Consistent with the findings of others , positive staining with VEGF-C and -D was observed in the normal mammary epithelial cells , tumour-associated macrophages , stromal cells and __ECs__ Vascular endothelial cell growth factor-D showed positive staining in the vascular smooth muscle fibres .
Sixty-seven ( 37% ) and 91 ( 44% ) specimens showed strong staining with VEGF-C and -D , respectively .
The relationship between expressions of the three growth factors was analyzed .
Specimens with high expression of VEGF-A found to be significantly associated with high expression of VEGF-C ( P=0.046 ) but not with expression of VEGF-D ( P=0.354 ) .
There was , however , a significant association between expression of VEGF-C and -D where 64% of cases with high expression of VEGF-C had high expression of VEGF-D ( P=0.001 ) , Table 1.
Relationships amongst expression of VEGFs , angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis
Lymph vessel density ranged from 0.015 mm-2 to 8.59 mm-2 with a mean of 1.7 mm-2±0.1 and a median of 1.37. Fifty-five ( 31.1% ) specimens were characterised with a high __LVD__ , Figure 2A .
__MVD__ ranged from 1.0 to 7.6 with a mean of 2.5±0.09 and a median of 2.3. Seventy-six ( 42.9% ) specimens were characterised with high __MVD__ , Figure 2B .
The relationship amongst VEGF-A , -C and -D expression , __MVD__ and __LVD__ are summarised in Table 2. Tumours with high expression of VEGF-A were significantly associated with both a higher __MVD__ ( P<0.001 ) and higher __LVD__ ( P=0.013 ) .
Such tumours had a mean __MVD__ of 2.9±0.15 and a mean __LVD__ of 1.5±0.11 compared to 2.2±0.11 and 2.0±0.19 for specimens with low VEGF-A expression respectively .
Similar findings were found with tumours with high expression , of VEGF-C .
Such tumours had a mean __MVD__ of 2.8±0.17 and a mean __LVD__ of 2.2±0.22 compared with 2.3±0.11 and 1.5±0.11 for patients with low VEGF-C expression respectively ( P=0.002 for __MVD__ and P=0.014 for __LVD__ ) , such relationships are illustrated using box plots in Figure 3. No statistical significant association was found between expression of VEGF-D and __LVD__ or with __MVD__ .
Relationships between expression of VEGFs and clinicopathological criteria
A comparison between low and high growth factor expressing tumours was conducted to examine for potential associations with clinicopathological characteristics .
High expression of VEGF-A was significantly associated with tumours larger than 1.5 cm ( P=0.038 ) and also with grade III tumours ( P<0.001 ) .
Sixty-four percent of breast ca__PR__ status express significantly higher levels of VEGF-A than hormonal receptor positive carcinomas ( P<0.001 and P=0.004 , respectively ) .
A significant association was also found with the presence of axillary __LN__ ( P<0.001 ) and presence of distant metastasises ( P=0.010 ) but not with patients age .
A significant positive relationship between VEGF-C expression and presence of __LN__ metastasis ( P<0.001 ) was detected .
Tumours larger than 1.5 cm had a significantly higher level of VEGF-C expression ( P=0.023 ) but unlike VEGF-A , no association was found in relation to the tumour grade ( P=0.214 ) or with the hormonal receptor status ( P=0.865 for ER and P=0.624 for __PR__ ) .
No significant association was found between expression of VEGF-D and any of the clinicopathological criteria .
However , a larger proportion of tumours with high expression with VEGF-D ( 54% ) had __LN__ metastasis compared to low expressing tumours ( 42% ) but was not statistically significant ( P=0.187 ) .
Prognostic significance of growth factor expression
Kaplan-Meier analysis for __OS__ and __DFI__ were conducted to investigate whether expression of VEGF-A , -C and -D had any prognostic significance .
From univariate analysis , high expression of VEGF-A was significantly associated with shorter __OS__ ( P=0.029 ) , Figure 4A .
High expression of VEGF-C was significantly associated with both shorter __OS__ ( P=0.025 and __DFI__ ( P=0.028 ) ( Figure 4B and C ) , however VEGF-D was neither associated with __DFI__ nor __OS__ .
Only VEGF-C retained significance upon multivariate analysis , when adjusted for tumour size , tumour grade and patient age ( P=0.047 , hazard ratio 2.854 ; 95% confidence interval 1.016-8.015 ) .
Tumours were subsequently recategorised according to expression of VEGF-A and -C into four groups ; group ( A ) ; tumours with low expression of both VEGF-A and -C , group ( B ) ; tumours with high expression of VEGF-A , group ( C ) ; tumours with high expression of VEGF-C and group ( D ) ; tumours with high expression of both VEGF-A and -C .
On survival analysis , tumours with high expression of both VEGF-A and -C had the shortest __OS__ when compared with the other three groups ( P<0.001 ) .
The prognostic significance of __LVD__ and __MVD__ will be a focus of a separate report examining the role of lymphatic distribution , density and lymphovascular invasion in relationship to clinicopathological criteria of tumours and patients survival .
DISCUSSION
The present report studied the expression of VEGF-A , -C and -D in breast cancer and correlated results with the lymphangiogenic and angiogenic characteristics of the tumours .
Vascular endothelial growth factor-A was originally identified as an EC-specific growth factor that induces angiogenesis and increases vascular permeability .
It was found to be expressed in normal human tissues including liver , kidney , adrenal glands , lung and stomach .
In the study of Brown et al , ( 1993 ) , VEGF-A mRNA was detected in the breast cancer cells whereas the corresponding proteins were found in both tumour cells and the __ECs__ , indicating that VEGF-A is secreted by tumour cells then undergoes processing in the __ECM__ to be entrapped by the receptors on the surface of the __ECs__ .
In the current report , and in agreement with such previous findings , positive staining for VEGF-A was detected in the __ECs__ , in the normal epithelial mammary duct cells as well as in the tumour cells .
Similar to findings reported by other studies on breast cancer and on other tumour types , tumours with high expression of VEGF-A were characterised by a significantly higher __MVD__ .
This may be due to the multiple effects of VEGF-A on __ECs__ .
Not only is it a potent mitogenic factor but it also stimulates __ECs__ to secrete cytokines essential for cell migration and sprouting of new vessels .
It has long been supposed that VEGF-A had no association with lymphangiogenesis , however , in two recent experimental studies , VEGF-A overexpression was found to induce formation of new lymph vessels and dilatation of pre-existing ones .
This action was found to be mediated through stimulation of VEGFR-2 , alpha1beta1 and alpha2beta1 integrins on the surface of __LECs__ .
Certain studies have reported a significant relationship between VEGF-A expression and lymphangiogenesis in malignant lymphoma and in lung carcinoma .
The current study is the first , to our knowledge , to report such a relationship in human breast cancer , in that a significant association between VEGF-A expression and high __LVD__ was observed .
Such results suggest an important role for VEGF-A in the induction of both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis in breast cancer .
High expression of VEGF-A was found to be associated with tumours larger than 1.5 cm in size .
This is in agreement with a previous study on breast cancer and one on lung cancer , where they found that high expression of VEGF-A was not only associated with larger tumours but also with larger metastatic deposits , likely through the growth factor inducing a rich vascular network , and a correspondingly more nutritious environment for tumour growth .
The current study also found that such tumours behaved more aggressively , as they were significantly associated with the presence of __LN__ metastasis ( P<0.001 ) , distant metastasis ( P=0.01 ) and a poorer survival ( P=0.029 ) .
These findings are similar to others , both in breast cancer and other tumour types ( Toi et al , 1995b ; Linderholm et al , 1999 ; O-Charoenrat et al , 2001 ) .
Although the effect of VEGF-A expression can be mediated by an increased vascular network , it should be noted that the growth factor has also been shown to increase breast cancer cell survival through direct action on VEGFR-2 that has been found to be expressed on the surface of the breast cancer cells .
Vascular endothelial cell growth factor-A production by , and VEGFR-2 activation on , the surface of tumour cells indicates the presence of a distinct autocrine signalling loop that enables breast cancer cells to promote their own growth and survival by activation of VEGFR-2 .
The findings in this study support others that have reported the important role of VEGF-A in the progression of breast cancer ; a role mediated through angiogenesis and promotion of tumour cell survival , and add the induction of lymphangiogenesis as another possible mechanism .
Similar to previous reports , the present study detected positive staining for VEGF-C and -D in normal mammary epithelial cells at a weaker intensity than in the surrounding invasive component suggesting a role in remodelling lymphatic and blood vasculature in mammary stroma during the menstrual cycle .
It is known that the normal human mammary gland undergoes a well-defined sequence of changes in both epithelial and stromal compartments during the menstrual cycle , with increased angiogenesis during the ovulatory phase under effect of hormonal changes .
Using animal models , VEGF-C induced formation of new lymph vessels in the chick chorioallantoic membrane , induced lymphangiogenesis around islet of Langerhans in the pancreas which , normally , are not surrounded with lymphatics , induced hyperplasia and dilatation of the dermal lymphatics when overexpressed in transgenic mice and increased __LVD__ and __LN__ metastasis in xenografted breast cancer .
The present study reports a significant association between expression of VEGF-C and __LVD__ similar to other findings reported in breast cancer and other tumour types .
This is mostly likely due to the stimulatory effect of VEGF-C on VEGFR-3 and alpha9 beta1 integrin on the LEC surface .
Stimulation of VEGFR-3 transmits potent mitogenic signals into __LECs__ , whereas activation of integrin induces redistribution of the cellular actin cytoskeleton , leading to change in cell shape and formation of pseudopodia enabling cells to migrate eventually new lymphangiogenesis .
When processed through proteolysis in the __ECM__ to mature forms , VEGF-C has been reported to also activate VEGFR-2 on the surface of the __BECs__ , thereby inducing angiogenesis .
Such effects have been reported in experimental studies , but has not been fully studied in human breast cancer .
Unlike a recent report by Hu_et_al , the present study indicates that tumours with high expression of VEGF-C are significantly associated with a higher __MVD__ , suggesting that VEGF-C has an additional angiogenic effect in breast cancer and may reflect active proteolysis found in the tumour microenvironment .
The study by Hu and co-workers found no such association , however , such differences may reflect the different patient population and the smaller number of specimens in the study by Hu .
Similar to other studies , when high expression of VEGF-C was examined in relation to the clinicopathological characteristics and to patient survival , a significant positive relationship was found with the presence of both __LN__ metastasis ( P<0.001 ) and distant metastasis ( P=0.008 ) .
High expression was also significantly associated with the occurrence of regional recurrence ( P=0.025 ) , and poorer __OS__ ( P=0.028 ) , perhaps due to the potent ability of VEGF-C to induce both lymphangiogenesis and angiogenesis , thereby providing open channels for dissemination of malignant cells .
Tumours which express high levels of both VEGF-A and -C were found to have the worst prognosis when compared with tumours expressing low levels of both factors or tumours expressing high levels of either of the growth factors individually .
These results support the notion that the two __VEGF__ family members may be involved in tumour progression at two interrelated steps .
Evaluation of expression of both VEGF-A and -C may be an important factor to identify breast cancer patients at higher risk of recurrence and in need of adjuvant therapy .
VEGF-D is a relatively recent member of the __VEGF__ family that shares some structural and functional properties with VEGF-C .
In experimental animal tumour models , overexpression of VEGF-D was found to be significantly associated with higher rate of __LN__ metastasis , increased tumour angiogenesis and larger tumour sizes ( Stacker et al , 2001 ; Von Marschall et al , 2005 ; Yonemura et al , 2005 ) .
However , in human tumours , there is variation amongst results .
It has been reported to be significantly associated with high __LVD__ , __LN__ metastasis and poorer survival in gastric , endometrial and colorectal carcinomas .
In head and neck tumours ( O-Charoenrat et al , 2001 ) , such relationships have not been found .
In other studies in breast and in lung carcinoma , low levels of expression of VEGF-D was associated with poorer prognosis .
In the current study , there was a trend for tumours with higher VEGF-D expression to have a higher rate of __LN__ metastasis , regional recurrence and distant metastasis , however , none of these reached statistical significance .
Similar findings were reported by Yang_et_al .
In addition , no significant association was found between expression of VEGF-D and either __LVD__ or __MVD__ .
In a study on breast cancer , a significant association was found between high VEGF-D gene expression , using real-time polymerase chain reaction and __LVD__ .
Such differences in results may be due to the different methods in assessment of VEGF-D expression .
Although VEGF-D showed lymphangiogenic and angiogenic effects in xenografted tumours , its biological role in human breast cancer is still unclear and is in need of further study .
It is probable that VEGF-D plays different roles in different tumour types .
In conclusion , it appears from this study of human breast cancers that , as has been reported by in vitro studies , VEGF-A plays a role in lymphangiogenesis .
It also appears that breast cancers , which express high levels of VEGF-A and -C are characterised by greater angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis and are associated with the presence of both __LN__ and distant metastasis .
Such tumours behave more aggressively as indicated by the associations with shorter __DFI__ and __OS__ .
Both growth factors appear to play an important role in the progression of breast carcinoma and to have a significant impact on patient prognosis .
Examination of expression of either VEGF-A and -C can be used to identify a subset of breast cancer at higher risk for development of recurrence and distant metastasis , with the recommendation that both be assessed to further delineate those at highest risk .
