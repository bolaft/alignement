1. Introduction
Growth of breast cancers result from pathways driving cellular proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis , mediated by the __PI3-K__ induced activation of __PI3-K__ /Akt .
Oestrogen , insulin-like growth factors as well as the __EGF__ family members including HER-2 , play a key role in activating __PI3-K__ / Akt signalling .
Activation of Akt influences cell cycle progression through dysregulation of the cell cycle checkpoint protein p53 and its cell cycle inhibitor , p21WAF1 / CIP1 .
Human Akt exists as three closely related isoforms : Akt-1 , -2 and -3 that are catalytically inactive in the cytosol and are recruited to the plasma membrane through phosphorylation activation at threonine 308 and serine 473 by __PI3-K__ , with a rapid nuclear localisation of Akt .
All Akt-isoforms may be amplified and overexpressed in breast tumours , with Akt-1 universally predominant in most tissues , compared with Akt-2 in insulin-responsive tissues and Akt-3 in association with oestrogen receptor ( ER ) negative breast tumours .
In vitro , breast carcinoma cell lines have increased levels of Akt-1 and Akt-2 expression , compared with normal breast epithelial cells with activated Akt ( pAkt ) representative of equivalent phosphorylation sites in all Akt isoforms .
In vivo studies , in large part affirm the correlation between pAkt and levels of Akt-1 and Akt-2 in breast tumours .
HER-2 signalling via Akt is suggested by a variable correlation between HER-2 expression and pAkt in breast cancers , with a less consistent relationship between HER-2 and respective Akt-1 and -2 isoforms .
Potential clinical implications relate to evidence of activated Akt in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 breast cancer cells , with breast cancers demonstrating diminished efficacy to radiotherapy .
In vitro HER-2 / neu activates Akt to block apoptosis through inactivation of p53 and p21WAF1 / CIP1 . p53 is a nuclear transcription factor that maintains genomic integrity , in part through the universal cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor , p21WAF1 / CIP1 .
Akt targets p21WAF1 / CIP1 through phosphorylation to produce cytoplasmic p21WAF1 / CIP1 that blocks apoptosis and correlates with HER-2 expression in breast cancers .
Inactivation of p53 occurs through other Akt pathways that target Hdm2 to enhance p53 degradation . p53 transactivates Hdm2 ( Human Mdm2 ; Murine double minute 2 ) that negatively regulates p53 through ubiquitination and Hdm2-mediated nuclear export of p53 for its cytoplasmic degradation .
Nuclear import and export is a feature of both p53 and Hdm2 with implications for their functional regulation , such that cytoplasmic p53 is associated with poor prognostic tumours .
Both wild-type and mutant p53 are evident in cytoplasmic p53-expressing cell lines and breast cancers .
Akt phosphorylates Hdm2 to produce its nuclear localisation and enhanced degradation of p53 with some evidence of preferential nuclear Hdm2 expression in HER-2 expressing breast cancers .
A recent study in breast cancer shows increased activation of Akt-isoforms ( pAkt ) and their correlation with disease-free survival , with implications that pAkt may be important in breast cancer growth and outcome .
The aim of this study was to e__IDC__ of the breast using an __IDC__ -specific antibody and to examine pAkt in relation to other factors involved in the pathway , such as HER-2 expression as well as p53 and Hdm2 levels and subcellular localisation on IHC .
Furthermore , it was important to evaluate pAkt in relation to clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in breast cancer .
We have shown pAkt to be expressed ubiquitously in the cytoplasm of 81% of IDCs , with no activation of Akt in 19% of tumours. pAkt is more likely associated with larger tumours and increasing levels of cytoplasmic p53 with implications for patient outcome .
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Patients
The study included 97 patients aged 26 - 88 years ( median 59 years ) with diagnoses of __IDC__ of the breast between 1996 and 2000 at the Bristol Royal Infirmary , Bristol , UK .
Regional Ethics Committee approval was granted prior to commencement of the study .
Forty patients underwent a __WLE__ and a mastectomy was performed in the remaining women ( n = 55 ) in whom pAkt was evaluable .
Axillary lymphadenopathy was evaluable in 84 patients with 34 lymph node negative , and 50 node positive ( N1 : mobile ipsilateral , or N2 : fixed ipsilateral ) patients .
No axillary surgery was undertaken in the remaining 11 patients due to age-related co-morbidity .
Clinicopathological subgroups were analysed according to the __NPI__ .
Evaluation of the __NPI__ was precluded in 13 patients due to non-evaluable regional lymphadenopathy and tumour size .
Adjuvant treatment groups comprised : tamoxifen alone in 54 patients , CMF- and anthracycline-containing regimes in 15 and 21 patients , respectively .
Five patients received no adjuvant treatment .
The median follow-up duration was 51 months ( range 6 - 120 months ) .
All were primary tumours .
Tumour samples were collected and freshly fixed in buffered formalin according to a standardised protocol at a single institution .
Tumours were classified according to the __NHSBSP__ Guidelines and were graded by the modified Bloom 's grading system .
Oestrogen receptor ( ER ) immunostaining was performed according to standard methods and assessed using the quick-score ( 0 - 8 ) .
Tumour proliferation was assessed using nuclear Ki67 immunostaining as described , with tonsillar tissue used as a positive control and primary antibody substitution with __TBS__ as a negative control .
The percentage of Ki67 staining was scored and analysed as a continuum on univariate and multivariate analyses , with a median cut-off of 10% ( <10% vs. greater-or-equal , slanted10% ) , .
HER-2 immunostaining was performed and was scored according to described methods .
Lymphovascular invasion was assessed as present or not , and together with ER , HER-2 and Ki67 was analysed in the Department of Pathology ( by CS and CC ) .
2.2. Immunohistochemistry
pAkt immunoreactivity , specifically phosphorylation of serine 473 , was evaluated using the rabbit polyclonal antibody ( Cell Signaling Technology # 9277 , New England Biolabs , Beverly , MA , USA ) at a dilution of 1:800 .
The anti-pAkt antibody is recommended specifically for immunohistochemistry and has been validated by ELISA and flow cytometry . pAkt immunostaining of IDCs was compared with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded cell buttons , using LNCAP prostate carcinoma cells as a positive control for pAkt , and LNCAP cells treated with the specific __PI3-K__ inhibitor ( LY291002 ) as a negative control .
Hdm2 expression was assessed using the mouse monoclonal antibody OP46 ( Oncogene Research , CN Biosciences , Nottingham , UK ) that detects C-terminal Hdm2 with specificity for the 90 kDa isoform .
OP46 was selected following testing with other antibodies including 2A10 and 3G5 ( A.J. Levine , Rockefeller University , New York , USA ) , both of which had technical or other limitations .
OP46 was used at a 1:80 dilution of 100 µg / ml and evaluated in the context of Hdm2-overexpressing A375 malignant melanoma cells , and negatively controlled using IgG2b that was substituted for the primary antibody .
Biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody ( DAKO E0354 , 1:300 dilution of 1.26 mg / ml , Ely , Cambridgeshire , UK ) was used for Hdm2. p53 immunostaining was performed as described elsewhere using the DO7 monoclonal antibody ( Novocastra Laboratories , Newcastle-upon-Tyne , UK ) .
Breast carcinomas known to overexpress p53 with known TP53 gene mutations and protein accumulation were used as positive controls .
Negative controls were obtained by omitting the primary antibodies .
Formalin-fixed paraffin sections of breast cancer tissue and cell pellets ( controls ) were subjected to immunohistochemical staining with heat antigen retrieval in citrate buffer ( pH6 ) .
Primary antibodies for pAkt and Hdm2 were incubated at 4 °C overnight ( 18 h ) , except p53 that was incubated for 1 h at room temperature .
Biotinylated goat anti-rabbit ( DAKO E0432 , 1:300 dilution of 1.09 mg / ml , Ely , Cambridgeshire , UK ) , was used for pAkt and biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse ( DAKO E0354 ) for Hdm2 and p53 for 30 min at room temperature .
Signal enhancement was achieved with streptavidin and biotinylated horseradish peroxidase ( Stre__DAB__ for 5 - 10 min prior to counterstaining with haematoxylin .
The degree of staining intensity and the proportion of cells with pAkt , Hdm2 and p53 immunoreactivity in the nucleus and cytoplasm were graded semi-quantitatively to produce an __IDS__ for each localisation in IDCs .
Initial scoring was of 10 HPFs , however , in view of the homogeneous staining this was reduced to 5 HPFs. pAkt scoring was analysed as reported previously for activated Akt-1 and was evaluated as negative ( 0 ; + ) ; weak / moderate ( ++ ) and strongly positive ( +++ ) .
A score of 0 or 1+ was considered negative and positivity was evaluated as 2+ or 3+ .
Scoring of pAkt was analysed as a continuum in statistical calculations of correlations with other variables .
Nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 and p53 immunoreactivity were scored using the principles of the __IDS__ or H-score , but adapting this system to the quick-score previously used to describe nuclear immunoreactivity .
A __MQS__ giving an overall score of 0 - 8 was standardised for nuclear as well as cytoplasmic expression .
Sections were independently scored by two pathologists ( CS and CC ) in the Department of Pathology .
Scores were assessed as a continuum for the purposes of statistical correlation , unless otherwise stated .
2.3. Statistical analysis
Data was analysed with the SPSS 10.0 for Windows statistics software and summarised with descriptive statistics .
The association between pAkt and patient characteristics was assessed using the Spearman non-parametric test for continuous variables and the 2 test for categorical factors .
The relationship between pAkt and the subcellular localisation of p53 and Hdm2 was analysed using the Spearman correlation for non-parametric data , with the pAkt and p53 / Hdm2 used as continuous variables .
Analyses of survival data were performed using the log-rank test and the Cox regression model , with survival curves computed using the Kaplan - Meier method .
For pAkt , univariate and multivariate analyses were performed , the latter adjusting for __NPI__ score and treatment received ( tamoxifen/chemotherapy / none ) .
As the __NPI__ is based on nodal involvement , on tumour size and on grade , patients ( n = 13 ) with non-evaluable lymphadenopathy and tumour size were excluded from the multivariate regression analyses .
3. Results
3.1. pAkt expression and association with clinicopathological factors
pAkt immunoreactivity was evaluable in 95 cases , and scored positively in 77 ( 81% ) with a pattern of staining that was homogeneous and cytoplasmic .
Activation of Akt was analysed as described ( Methodology ) .
Strong expression was seen in 22% ( n = 21 ) of IDCs .
The majority of tumours expressed moderate ( 2+ ) levels of pAkt , with few showing no activation of Akt ( 0 / 1+ ) . pAkt overexpression was tumour specifi__DCIS__ ( data not shown ) .
Activated Akt was analysed in relation to clinicopathological criteria , with no association to HER-2 ( either where scores were analysed categorically or as a continuum ) that may relate in part to the small number ( 16% ) of HER-2 overexpressing breast cancers. pAkt expression was positive in 13 ( 87% ; n = 15 ) cases of HER-2 - overexpressing ( 2+ / 3+ ) breast cancers , although this was not statistically significant . pAkt positive ( 2+ / 3+ ) tumours were significantly larger ( P = 0.007 ; Table 2 ) , than IDCs in which Akt was inactive ( 0 / 1+ ) , with a similar trend in lymph node positive patients ( P = 0.085 ) and the __NPI__ ( P = 0.069 ) .
Tumour numbers ( n ) s__IHC__ for ( a ) pAkt , and using the __MQS__ ( 0 - 8 ) for ( b ) p53 and ( c ) Hdm2 expression in the nucleus and cytoplasm of invasive cancers. pAkt expression was cytoplasmic and evaluated as negative ( 0 / 1+ ) or positive ( 2+ / 3+ ) .
IHC expression was individually assessed in the nucleus and cytoplasm for p53 and Hdm2 , and defined as negative ( 0 ) ( MQS-score 0 - 2 ) , weak / moderate ( 1+ ) ( MQS-score 3 - 5 ) and strong ( 2+ ) ( MQS-score 6 - 8 ) .
Positivity for p53 and Hdm2 expression was defined as an __MQS__ of greater-or-equal , slanted3 ( 1+ / 2+ ) .
3.2. Relationships between pAkt expression and subcellular expression of p53 and Hdm2
pAkt expression was measured as a continuum and was analysed in relation to p53 and Hdm2 positivity ( H-score greater-or-equal , slanted3 vs. <3 ) in the nucleus and cytoplasm of breast cancers . p53 immunoreactivity and subcellular localisation was evaluable in 88 ( 91% ) cases of IDCs , with technical exclusions based on fatty breast specimens failing to adhere to glass slides .
Immunohistochemically , p53 was detectable in 25 ( 28% ) IDCs ( H-score greater-or-equal , slanted3 ) , with similar levels of nuclear ( 25 cases ) and cytoplasmic ( 22 cases ) expression .
Weak to moderate ( H-score 3 - 5 ) nuclear p53 expression was observed with similar cytoplasmic staining .
There was no nuclear or cytoplasmic p53 expression ( H-score 0 - 2 ) in the majority of invasive breast cancers .
Strong nuclear p53 expression ( H-score 6 - 8 ) was evident in 16% of IDCs , with 6% of these expressing intense cytoplasmic staining .
Activation of Akt was significantly associated with cytoplasmic p53 expression ( Spearman correlation coefficient ( cc ) 0.241 , P = 0.025 ) , with no association with nuclear p53 ( cc - 0.141 , P = 0.196 ) when all variables were analysed as a continuum ( data not shown ) .
Hdm2 expression and subcellular distribution was evaluable in 85 ( 88% ) cases of IDCs .
Nuclear Hdm2 was detectable ( H-score greater-or-equal , slanted3 ) in 40 ( 47% ) cases , with a similar proportion of cytoplasmic staining .
A minority of IDCs strongly expressed nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 .
Approximately half of invasive cancers were negative for nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 .
There were no associations between pAkt and a specific nuclear or cytoplasmic localisation of Hdm2 .
3.3. Relationship of clinicopathological factors to prognosis and the predictive potential of pAkt expression
__OS__ and __OS__ were determined in 87 and 95 patients , respectively , ( primary tumours ) , with a median follow-up of 51 months ( range 6 - 120 months ) .
Disease relapse ( local or distant recurrences ) occurred in 29 women , in whom 25 were post-mastectomy .
The majority of recurrences were distant , with a single cutaneous recurrence following breast conservation surgery and a further four local recurrences associated with synchronous metastatic disease .
Of those who relapsed , death was confirmed in 22 patients , with 8 suspected deaths in the absence of a recorded mortality date that were consequently not included in the regression analyses .
Locoregional recurrence occurred at a median duration of 26 months ( range 3 - 65 months ) from diagnosis .
Breast cancer related mortality occurred at a median of 26 months ( range 8 - 98 months ) from presentation .
The mean duration of __OS__ and __DFS__ were 94 and 88 months , respectively .
Four-year __DFS__ and __OS__ were 70% and 77% , respectively .
The relationship of established clinicopathological features with __OS__ and __DFS__ were analysed using Cox regression analysis .
Generally poor prognostic factors , such as large tumour size , high tumour grade and lymph node metastases , were significantly associated with decreased __OS__ and __DFS__ , so that __NPI__ was highly significantly associated with outcome .
ER-negative and HER-2 overexpressing breast cancers were associated with reduced __OS__ and __DFS__ on univariate analysis , but were not independent prognosticators .
High tumour proliferation ( Ki67 on IHC ) , although associated with a lower percentage of patients remaining disease-free ( __DFS__ ) and alive ( __OS__ ) at four years , did not reach statistical significance .
Although mastectomy was associated with a reduced __DFS__ and __OS__ ( univariate , Table 3 ) the type of surgical excision was not an independent predictor of outcome ( multivariate ) , and may reflect stage at presentation .
Ninety-five percent confidence intervals ( 95% CI ) and P-values are given for the results of both the univariate and multivariate analyses .
Data for univariate analysis was evaluable in 95 patients and a multivariate analysis on 84 patients that excluded non-evaluable __NPI__ in 11 patients .
The multivariate analysis is adjusted for __NPI__ ( nodes , grade and size ) , surgical ( __WLE__ / mastectomy ) and adjuvant treatment ( tamoxifen/chemotherapy / none ) .
All clinicopathological variables were analysed as a continuum .
Univariate and multivariate analyses for pAkt ( __OS__ ) were evaluated on 87 and 77 patients , respectively , ( pAkt ( __DFS__ ) univariate ( 95 patients ) and multivariate ( 84 patients ) ) .
Relationships that reached significance ( P < 0.05 ) are highlighted in bold .
__NPI__ , Nottingham prognostic group ; ER , oestrogen receptor ; IHC , immunohistochemistry .
Univariate and multivariate analysis using the continuous score for pAkt expression were used to investigate possible relationships to patient outcome .
In univariate analysis activation of Akt was associated with a reduced __DFS__ ( P = 0.04 ) , with a similar trend , although not significant , in pAkt positive ( 2+ / 3+ ) patients on Kaplan - Meier survival curves .
Activation of Akt was not an independent prognosticator for __DFS__ or __OS__ in this study .
4. Discussion
Increased Akt levels are a feature of tumourigenesis with in vitro evidence in human breast carcinoma cell lines and increased expression in breast cancers .
Few studies have clarified the functional implications of any particular Akt isoform in breast cancers .
This study evaluates all serine 473 phosphorylated Akt isoforms and shows positive pAkt expression in 81% , compared with similar studies showing 54% and 27% , respectively , .
This ubiquitous pAkt expression is likely to relate to multiple pathways involving tyrosine kinase-related growth factors and oncogenes .
Immunohistochemical pAkt expression did not reveal particular information regarding plasma membrane and nuclear staining , in large part as these phenomena relate to the rapidity of Akt activation .
Oestrogen-related breast cancer growth involves the __PI3-K__ / Akt pathway with inhibition of Akt activation by ICI182780 ( Faslodex ) .
No clear association has been shown between pAkt and ER status in this study or previous reports .
In vitro , HER-2 is strongly associated with activation of Akt in breast cancer cell lines and in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 cells .
In large part there is further evidence for this association in vivo , although some studies are inconsistent , more particularly with respect to correlations between HER-2 and particular Akt-isoforms .
The limited number of HER-2 overexpressing breast cancers ( n = 15 ) in this study may explain the lack of an association between HER-2 and pAkt .
HER-2 mediated breast cancer growth is also likely to activate cytoplasmic signalling through MAP kinase pathways with no specificity for __PI3-K__ / Akt signalling .
The association between pAkt and larger breast cancers emphasises the importance of the __PI3-K__ / Akt signalling pathway in promoting cell survival and cell growth , as well as confirming resistance to apoptosis .
Cellular commitment to apoptosis is likely to relate to the integration of two key pathways including p53-induced apoptosis and the aversion of cell death through Akt / __PKB__ .
A reciprocal cross-talk between p53 and Akt involves Akt inactivation of p53 , as well as a p53-dependent downregulation of Akt .
This suggests an anticipated inverse association between pAkt and p53 levels , whereby mutant p53 or immunohistochemical overexpression of p53 is associated with increased levels of Akt and its subsequent activation ( pAkt ) .
Similarly , the implication is that non-functional p53 is unable to destroy Akt .
Proportionately , more mutant or wild-type p53 may be detectable in the cytoplasm and has been implicated in poor prognostic breast cancers .
In this study , the association of cytoplasmic p53 with increasing levels of pAkt ( P = 0.025 ) suggests the loss of a p53-dependent destruction of Akt and an association between two key tumourigenic pathways .
Stenmark-Askmalm_et_al. suggest that cytoplasmic p53 expression , compared with exclusive nuclear staining , in breast cancers is more likely to be associated with adverse pathobiological variables , such that our preliminary findings may reflect an association between two potential prognostic factors and merits future investigation .
The lack of a similar association between pAkt and nuclear p53 on IHC may support Stenmark-Askmalm_et_al. and imply other pathways involving p53 / Akt that include regulation through changes in subcellular localisation .
Activated Akt ( serine 473 ) increases Hdm2 activity to degrade p53 through a process that involves p53 nuclear export to the cytoplasm , and essentially depends on p53 transcriptional activation of Hdm2 .
A possible association between wild-type cytoplasmic p53 as a prerequisite for Akt-mediated degradation of p53 may also exist . p53 immunostaining is not necessarily tightly correlated with TP53 gene function , with detection of TP53 point mutations in 89% , as well as wild-type p53 protein .
A study of inflammatory breast cancers showed the presence of wild-type cytoplasmic p53 in 37% of cases , with further evidence that cytoplasmic p53 expression occurs in normal lactating breast tissue and is associated with intact p53 function in neuroblastoma cell lines .
Akt associates with Hdm2 with in vitro evidence of binding to , and phosphorylation of Hdm2 ( serine 166 and 186 ) to increase levels of Hdm2 expression and its enhanced nuclear localisation .
As discussed , this mechanism underlines Akt-induced inactivation of p53 .
In this study , there were no clear associations between pAkt and Hdm2 levels of expression .
Hdm2 expression is a feature of tumourigenesis , with enhanced transcription , translation and an extended protein half-life .
The subcellular localisation of Hdm2 involves evidence of cytoplasmic Hdm2 in vitro , and in a series of breast cancers in vivo .
Akt phosphorylation of Hdm2 in proximity to the nuclear localisation and export signals is necessary for the translocation of Hdm2 from the cytoplasm into the nucleus .
In a preliminary series of breast cancers Akt-positive tumours were associated with predominant nuclear Hdm2 expression , compared with both nuclear and cytoplasmic Hdm2 in Akt-negative breast cancers .
By contrast , this study shows no specific association between Akt expression and a preferential subcellular localisation of Hdm2 .
Possible confirmation of our findings and a suggestion as to the complexity of these pathways is highlighted by another in vitro study in which Akt-induced phosphorylation of Hdm2 had little effect on its subcellular localisation .
It is likely that activated Akt is more discriminatory as a prognosticator than Akt-1 and Akt-2 levels , respectively .
Its clinical significance is suggested with a single study in 93 breast cancers demonstrating its independent prediction of a shorter __DFS__ , and another study implying that pAkt predicts radioresistance .
Our study examining serine 473 phosphorylation of all Akt isoforms suggests an association between their activation and a shorter interval to disease progression ( P = 0.04 ; univariate ) .
Lack of independent prognostic significance may reflect small patient numbers , although similar to the study of Pérez-Tenorio and colleagues and Stål and colleagues .
__PI3-K__ / Akt signalling has also been implicated in both tamoxifen and taxol resistance to suggest a possible link between this pathway and treatment failure , which may have implications for disease recurrence .
5. Conclusion
Activation of Akt / __PKB__ by __PI3-K__ has important implications for breast cancer growth through mechanisms inactivating p53 that involve Hdm2 .
We have demonstrated that universal activation of Akt isoforms is associated with immunohistochemical p53 expression , which is preferentially cytoplasmic .
Alternative pathways , whereby Akt regulates p53 , could involve its cytoplasmic localisation .
Although HER-2 is likely to activate Akt , variable associations in vivo suggest a greater complexity of these pathways in human cancers .
