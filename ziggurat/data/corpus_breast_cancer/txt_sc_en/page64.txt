1. Introduction
Endocrine manipulation has been used with great success for the treatment of hormone-sensitive breast cancer , and the dramatic fall in mortality from the disease in both the UK and the USA over the past 15 years has been attributed to its use .
The first pioneering report of endocrine manipulation of breast cancer was made by Beatson , who carried out a landmark series of cases of surgical castration for the treatment of advanced breast cancer .
Approximately 50 years later , Huggins and his colleagues first described surgical adrenalectomy as second-line endocrine therapy .
Over the next 50 years endocrinologists and clinicians made a concerted effort to understand and exploit the mechanisms underlying these treatments for optimal clinical benefit .
A thread that runs through this endeavour has been the search for the mechanism of response .
Identification of the role of oestrogen receptor ( ER ) in selecting the most appropriate patients for treatment was a fundamental step in meeting this aim .
Until recently , tamoxifen , a __SERM__ , had been the endocrine therapy of choice for hormone-responsive early breast cancer in postmenopausal women , having been used for more than 30 years .
Concerns over serious side effects associated with long-term use of tamoxifen , such as increased incidence of endometrial cancer 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 and 7 and thromboembolic events 8 and 9 , coupled with the development of resistance , has led to the development of additional agents with improved efficacy and tolerability .
For postmenopausal women , the major source of oestrogen is from peripheral aromatisation of androgens synthesised in the adrenal gland .
The rate-limiting step in the pathway is catalysed by the aromatase enzyme and agents have therefore been developed that inhibit this key enzyme .
The modern third-generation __AIs__ , which include the non-steroidal agents anastrozole and letrozole and the steroidal compound exemestane , show increased potency with respect to both aromatase inhibition and subsequent oestrogen suppression compared with earlier __AIs__ , such as aminoglutethimide 12 and 13. The third-generation __AIs__ have been shown to be successful in advanced breast cancer 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 and 21 and both anastrozole and letrozole are now being evaluated in the adjuvant setting in patients with ER-positive tumours 22 , 23 , 24 and 25. Recent clinical data from the __AIs__ trial indicate that the position of tamoxifen as first-choice adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women is now being challenged by the __AIs__ and this paper reviews these data and their potential relevance to clinical practice .
2. Current status of adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen
The first trials of adjuvant tamoxifen therapy started in the late 1970s and involved control groups that were given no therapy versus tamoxifen for 1 or 2 years .
The __NATO__ study , which involved 1100 women , was the first study to show an advantage for __NATO__ in patients receiving adjuvant tamoxifen compared with placebo .
Most of the patients were postmenopausal and with or without nodal involvement , although node-positive premenopausal women were also included .
Less than half of the patients had histologically proven involved nodes .
After a median follow-up of 66 months there was a significant reduction in recurrence rate ( 36% ) and mortality ( 29% ) in patients receiving tamoxifen relative to placebo .
__NATO__ was followed by other studies investigating adjuvant tamoxifen for 2 or 5 years and the first overview of the results demonstrated that it was associated with reductions in relative risk of relapse ( 25% ) and death ( 17% ) over a 10 year follow-up period , regardless of nodal status .
Postmenopausal women with ER-positive tumours received the greatest benefit .
This was confirmed in the most recent overview published in 1998 , and the as yet unpublished 2000 overview has established that only women with ER-positive breast cancer should receive adjuvant tamoxifen .
The overview of 55 trials with adjuvant tamoxifen administered for 1 year , 2 years or 5 years versus no treatment in patients with early stage breast cancer showed that tamoxifen treatment produced highly significant benefits in terms of both disease recurrence and mortality ( proportional reductions in recurrence were 18% , 25% and 41% ; proportional reductions in death rate were 10% , 15% and 22% for 1 , 2 and 5 years of tamoxifen treatment , respectively ; P < 0.00001 for each ) .
Further investigations have been carried out to compare the effect of 2 , 5 and >5 years of treatment with tamoxifen 5 , 30 , 31 , 32 and 33. From these studies , 5 years of tamoxifen treatment appears to be the optimal duration of therapy in terms of patient benefit .
The benefit from 5 years of tamoxifen therapy persists through 10 years of follow-up .
No additional advantage was obtained from continuing tamoxifen therapy for more than 5 years .
Further clarification of optimal treatment duration is being investigated in two ongo__ATLAS__ trial , both of which completed recruitment in March 2005 .
In the aTTom trial , women who have been taking tamoxifen for at least 2 years ( 5 years now recommended ) are randomised to discontinuation or continuation of treatment for a further 3 years 35 and 36 , while the __ATLAS__ trial is randomizing women who have received tamoxifen for about 5 years to discontinuation or to tamoxifen for a further 5 years .
The use of tamoxifen is limited by the partial agonist activity it exerts on the ER , which is associated with its potentially life-threatening side effects , including increased incidence of endometrial cancer and uterine sarcoma 3 , 5 , 38 and 39. Tamoxifen has been shown to double the risk of endometrial cancer after 1 or 2 years of treatment , and the risk quadruples after 5 years of treatment .
The relationship between tamoxifen and endometrial cancer is time-dependent , which is of particular concern in the adjuvant setting where the duration of therapy is relatively long .
The risk is also irrespective of dose and does not decrease after cessation of treatment .
Studies have also provided__NSABP__ B-14 trial .
Hence , despite its efficacy these serious risks associated with long-term use of tamoxifen limit its risk:benefit profile as an adjuvant therapy .
3. The role of aromatase inhibitors for postmenopausal women
The first-generation AI aminoglutethimide became available approximately 25 years ago , but was unable to rival tamoxifen due to its lack of selectivity for the aromatase enzyme and its consequent toxicity .
After further development , formestane , a second-generation AI , possessing fewer side effects than aminoglutethimide , became available in 1993 .
Modern third-generation __AIs__ are highly specific for aromatase and have been shown to be effective and well tolerated as second-line therapies for postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer who have progressed on tamoxifen 14 , 19 , 21 and 42. In addition , anastrozole and letrozole have been show to be more effective compared with tamoxifen in the first-line setting in advanced disease 18 , 20 , 43 and 44 , with anastrozole also having significant tolerability benefits 18 and 20. __AIs__ do not possess the same partial oestrogenic agonist activity as tamoxifen , therefore fewer serious adverse events associated with their use were expected .
As a result , these __AIs__ represent ideal candidates for replacing tamoxifen in the adjuvant setting for postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive tumours , although the effects ( for example on bone ) of the more complete oestrogen suppression provided by these agents also needs to be considered .
4. Aromatase inhibitors as adjuvant therapy in postmenopausal women
There are several ongoing studies involving third-generation __AIs__ in the adjuvant setting .
Of these studies , the __ATAC__ and __BIG__ 1 - 98 trials are the only studies that directly compare an AI with tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy reported to date .
The __ITA__ trial , in which patients who had received 2 - 3 years of adjuvant tamoxifen were randomised to continue on tamoxifen or switch to anastrozole for the remainder of the 5 year adjuvant treatment period , was the first of the switching trials to be reported .
In addition , two other large multinational trials have investigated switching to an AI .
The first of these , the __BIG__ __IES__ , studied the steroidal AI exemestane , and the second , the combined Austrian and German trials ( ABCSG 8 / ARNO 95 ) , studied anastrozole in the same setting .
Finally , data are now available for the MA 17 trial of extended adjuvant therapy in which patients received 5 years standard adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen and were then randomised to placebo or letrozole for a further 5 years .
5. Comparison of __AIs__ versus tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy in early breast cancer
The __ATAC__ trial was designed to test the hypotheses that anastrozole was non-inferior or superior to tamoxifen and that the combination of anastrozole and tamoxifen was superior to tamoxifen alone as standard adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women newly diagnosed with early breast cancer .
A total of 9366 patients were recruited from 381 centres in 21 countries .
The initial and updated analyses of the __ATAC__ trial demonstrated that anastrozole significantly prolonged __DFS__ and __TTR__ , and reduced the incidence of contralateral breast cancer compared with tamoxifen 22 and 23. However , the combination treatment arm was closed after the initial analysis as no advantages were seen in efficacy and tolerability over the tamoxifen arm .
After a median follow-up of 68 months , when only 8% of patients remained on trial treatment , a completed treatment analysis was performed .
Anastrozole demonstrated significant improvements in __DFS__ ( __HR__ 0.87 ; 95% __HR__ 0.78 , 0.97 ; P = 0.01 ) and __TTR__ ( __HR__ 0.79 ; 95% __CI__ 0.70 , 0.90 ; P = 0.0005 ) compared with tamoxifen .
In the hormone receptor-positive subgroup ( 84% of the total population studied ) __DFS__ ( __HR__ 0.83 ; 95% __CI__ 0.73 , 0.94 ; P = 0.005 ) and __TTR__ ( __HR__ 0.74 ; 95% __CI__ 0.64 , 0.87 ; P = 0.0002 ) were also significantly longer for anastrozole compared with tamoxifen .
Notably , in terms of __DFS__ and __TTR__ , the absolute benefit of anastrozole over tamoxifen increased over time , even beyond completion of 5 years scheduled treatment .
Absolute differences in __DFS__ and __TTR__ also increased out to 6 years in the hormone receptor-positive subgroup .
There was a significant reduction in contralateral breast cancer in the anastrozole versus the tamoxifen group ( all patients 42% reduction , 95% __CI__ 12 , 62 ; P = 0.01 ; hormone receptor-positive patients 53% reduction , 95% __CI__ 25 , 71 ; P = 0.001 ) and a significant overall benefit was reported in time to distant recurrence for anastrozole ( __HR__ 0.86 ; 95% __CI__ 0.74 , 0.99 ; P = 0.04 ) .
A similar trend was observed in the subset of hormone receptor-positive patients ( __HR__ 0.84 ; 95% __CI__ 0.70 , 1.00 ; P = 0.06 ) .
Overall survival was similar between treatment groups , demonstrating that anastrozole maintains the established survival benefit seen with tamoxifen ( __HR__ 0.97 ; 95% __CI__ 0.85 , 1.12 ; P = 0.7 ) .
There was a 12% reduction in breast cancer deaths with anastrozole , although this did not reach statistical significance ( __HR__ 0.88 ; 95% __CI__ 0.74 , 1.05 ; P = 0.2 ) .
In terms of tolerability , predefined adverse events occurred with similar relative frequency in the completed treatment analysis compared with previous reports throughout the trial 22 and 23 but the absolute incidence of adverse events increased with longer follow-up .
Treatment with anastrozole was associated with significant reductions in the incidence of endometrial cancer , thromboembolic events , including pulmonary embolism and deep venous thromboembolic events , ischaemic cerebrovascular events , hot flushes , vaginal bleeding and discharge , compared with tamoxifen .
Furthermore , with the on-treatment safety data almost complete , the number of cardiovascular deaths in the anastrozole arm and the tamoxifen arm was similar ( 49 versus 46 , respectively ) .
Withdrawals due to adverse events were significantly less common with anastrozole than with tamoxifen ( 11.1% versus 14.3% , respectively ; P = 0.002 ) .
Likewise , drug-related serious adverse events were also significantly less common with anastrozole ( 4.7% versus 9.0% ; P < 0.0001 ) .
Although a higher incidence of fractures occured in the anastrozole arm , it appears that after the initial increase in the first 2 years of therapy in the updated analysis ( anastrozole versus tamoxifen , 7.1% versus 4.6% ; P < 0.001 ) , the relative fracture risk stabilised over time even though the patients remained on treatment .
This pattern continued with no further change in relative fracture risk for the full 68 month treatment period .
To date , anastrozole is the only AI with long-term safety and tolerability data from 5 years adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer .
The quality of life ( QoL ) of postmenopausal women participating in the __ATAC__ trial during the first 2 years of treatment has also been assessed .
Two years treatment with anastrozole , given alone or in combination with tamoxifen , did not appear to have a detrimental impact on QoL compared with use of tamoxifen alone .
In fact , compared with baseline , the QoL may improve over time in a pattern which was roughly equivalent across treatment arms .
The QoL subprotocol data show that the efficacy benefits demonstrated in patients in the anastrozole group were not at the expense of QoL , but there are differences in type and severity of endocrine symptoms associated with anastrozole or tamoxifen that need to be considered by clinicians and patients when making treatment decisions .
Results from the primary analysis of the __BIG__ 1-98 phase III trial have recently been reported .
The __BIG__ 1-98 trial was designed to incorporate both a head-to-head comparison of letrozole with tamoxifen and a sequencing of both agents , during the first 5 years following breast cancer surgery .
The primary analysis , performed at a median follow-up of 26 months , compared tamoxifen with letrozole , combining patients from monotherapy and sequential arms , as adjuvant therapy in 8028 postmenopausal women with ER-positive early breast cancer .
A second analysis , not yet completed , will evaluate the sequential arms .
Letrozole demonstrated a significant improvement compared with tamoxifen in the primary endpoint of __DFS__ ( __HR__ 0.81 ; 95% __CI__ 0.70 , 0.93 ; P = 0.003 ) .
All other efficacy endpoints also favoured letrozole , including __TTR__ ( __HR__ 0.72 ; 95% __CI__ 0.61 , 0.86 ; P = 0.0002 ) and time to distant recurrence ( __HR__ 0.73 ; 95% __CI__ 0.60 , 0.88 ; P = 0.0012 ) .
A total of 587 patients on letrozole , compared with 643 patients on tamoxifen , reported at least one serious adverse event .
Letrozole was associated with an increased risk of bone fractures but a decreased risk of venous thromboembolic side effects compared with tamoxifen .
Compared with tamoxifen , women treated with letrozole have a greater risk of stroke and cardiac events .
There was an increase in cardiac deaths ( 26 and 13 for letrozole and tamoxifen , respectively ) and in deaths due to cerebrovascular events ( 7 and 1 for letrozole and tamoxifen , respectively ) .
These events raise concerns at this early stage of assessment and further investigations with longer follow-up are necessary to establish the long-term safety and tolerability of letrozole .
It is important not to extrapolate data from the __ATAC__ trial to other __AIs__ , as there are differences in the pharmacological profiles of __AIs__ , including safety , pharmacokinetics , effects on lipids , bone absorption , steroidogenesis and specificity .
Clinical differences between the __AIs__ are now beginning to appear ( e.g. cardiovascular deaths in __ATAC__ / __BIG__ 1-98 ) and these may become more apparent following long-term treatment 13 and 52. Indeed , the American Society of Clinical Oncology Technology assessment of the __ATAC__ data notes that closely related agents with similar mechanisms of action may have different toxicity profiles .
6. Switching adjuvant endocrine treatment
During adjuvant treatment it may be desirable or necessary to switch patients from one treatment to another .
Possible rationales for switching adjuvant treatment from tamoxifen are reduced tamoxifen exposure , which is known to be associated with serious side effects when used in the long term , and tamoxifen resistance .
In addition , it is possible that switching patients who have already begun on tamoxifen to an AI may provide improved outcomes irrespective of the occurrence of serious side effects or tamoxifen resistance .
However , until recently it was unclear if the advantages of anastrozole compared with tamoxifen seen in the __ATAC__ trial might also apply to women already taking adjuvant tamoxifen .
The results from the __ITA__ trial first highlighted the potential benefits of switching from adjuvant tamoxifen to adjuvant anastrozole .
Preliminary results of the __ITA__ trial comparing 3 years of treatment with anastrozole or tamoxifen after an initial 2 year treatment with tamoxifen were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium , 2003 .
A total of 426 patients who had received 2 years of tamoxifen and were disease-free were assigned to continue on tamoxifen ( N = 218 ) or receive anastrozole ( N = 208 ) .
Events in each group are shown in Table 3. After adjusting for age , number of involved nodes , tumour grade and primary treatment , the results were in favour of anastrozole .
A decreased risk of relapse ( __HR__ 0.36 ; 95% __CI__ 0.17 , 0.75 ; P = 0.006 ) and of death ( __HR__ 0.18 ; 95% __CI__ 0.02 , 1.57 ; P = 0.07 ) , was apparent in those who had switched to anastrozole compared with those who remained on tamoxifen , and switching was associated with fewer serious adverse events ( 14 versus 29 ) .
These data suggest that patients already part way through their adjuvant tamoxifen course can still receive the benefits of anastrozole , in terms of a lower risk of disease recurrence and fewer serious adverse events , by changing therapy to anastrozole after 2 - 3 years rather than remaining on tamoxifen treatment .
Though promising , the __ITA__ is a small trial with a small number of events and without explicit stopping rules .
Findings from the __ITA__ study , which support switching to an AI , have now been confirmed by two other trials , the __BIG__ __IES__ and the combined ABCSG 8 / ARNO 95 trial .
The __IES__ is the largest study to date to investigate switching from tamoxifen to an AI compared with completing adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen .
The trial has followed 4742 women , who were randomised to switch to exemestane after 2 - 3 years tamoxifen , for a median of 30.6 months .
Exemestane significantly improved __DFS__ compared with the standard 5 years tamoxifen ( __HR__ 0.68 ; 95% __CI__ 0.56 , 0.82 ; P < 0.001 ) .
Cases of contralateral breast cancer were also reduced for women receiving exemestane ( __HR__ 0.44 ; 95% __CI__ 0.20 , 0.98 ; P = 0.04 ) .
Exemestane increased the risk of osteoporosis , arthralgia , visual disturbances and diarrhoea compared with tamoxifen but was associated with a lower incidence of thromboembolic disease , gynaecological symptoms , vaginal bleeding and cramps .
The prospectively planned combined analysis of the ABCSG 8 / ARNO 95 trial included more than 3000 women who , following primary surgery and exposure to 2 years of tamoxifen , received either 3 years of tamoxifen or 3 years of anastrozole .
At a median follow-up of 26 months , there were 110 events ( local or metastatic recurrence or contralateral breast cancer ) among women on tamoxifen and 67 events among women on anastrozole .
Three-year event-free survival favoured switching to anastrozole ( __HR__ 0.60 ; 95% __CI__ 0.44 , 0.81 ; P = 0.0009 ) .
Anastrozle also demonstrated a 39% improvement in distant recurrence-free survival compared with tamoxifen ( __HR__ 0.61 ; 95% __CI__ 0.42 , 0.87 ; P = 0.0067 ) .
Adverse events are consistent with the previously reported event profile for anastrozole , although tolerability data are only currently available from the ABCSG 8 arm of the trial .
7. Evaluation of the benefits of extended adjuvant therapy
Results of a double-blind , placebo-controlled trial ( MA 17 ; Fig. 4 ) to evaluate whether postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer who have completed 5 years of tamoxifen would benefit from treatment with letrozole for an additional 5 years have recently been published .
After a median follow-up of 2.4 years there was a significant difference in __DFS__ ( P < 0.001 ) , with 75 recurrences ( local or metastatic ) or new primary contralateral breast cancers in the letrozole group ( N = 2575 ) compared with 132 in the placebo group ( N = 2582 ) .
Although the estimated 4 year __DFS__ rates were significantly higher for letrozole ( 93% and 87% for letrozole and placebo , respectively ; P less-than-or-equals , slant 0.001 ) , only 20 patients were eligible for analysis at this time point , and therefore the data are not robust .
Adverse events , such as hot flushes , arthralgia , and myalgia , were more common in the letrozole group than the placebo group ( P < 0.05 ) , whereas vaginal bleeding was more common in the placebo group ( P = 0.01 ) .
The incidence of cardiovascular events or new fractures were numerically increased in the letrozole group compared with the placebo group , although these differences were not significant ( P = 0.40 and 0.24 , respectively ) .
Due to the highly significant result versus placebo at the preliminary analysis , the trial was terminated early and the results were published , diminishing the clinical usefulness of the data .
The very short follow-up of these data prevents the long-term outcomes of these different states from being established and thus the current data may not be meaningful .
The recurrence data available are a composite of local , metastatic and new primary cancer , which convey different risk probabilities and are associated with different treatment strategies .
There are also some concerns about the consequences of long-term use of letrozole due to its potent oestrogen suppressive effects , and it is thought that the early cessation of the study may mean that long-term adverse events are underestimated .
A final analysis of this study at a median follow-up of 2.5 years was presented at the 40th Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology 56 P. Goss , J. Ingle and S. Martino et al. , Updated analysis of the NCIC CTC MA.17 randomised placebo ( P ) controlled trial of letrozole ( L ) after five years of tamoxifen in postmenopausal women with early stage breast cancer , Proc Am Soc Clin Oncol 20 ( 2004 ) , p. abs847 " Best of oncology symposium " presented June 8 , 2004. .
Results were similar to the published interim analysis although updated survival data indicated that the group of women treated with letrozole had an 18% reduced risk of death compared with those who received placebo , and women with node-positive disease had a 39% reduced risk of death if treated with letrozole compared with placebo .
8. Discussion
Many elements need to be considered when assessing optimal endocrine treatment regimens for hormone receptor-positive patients , including the efficacy and safety profile of the agents used , and the QoL of the patient .
Alongside the emerging data are guidelines which assess the relevance of the research findings and translate these into clinical practice .
These provide both prescribing guidance for the physician and clear information for patients .
Guidelines state that endocrine treatment , including __AIs__ , should be initiated only for hormone receptor-positive tumours .
Furthermore , given the encouraging data from the trials described above , recommendations for the use of tamoxifen , up till now the endocrine therapy of choice in the adjuvant setting , have been revised .
The initial , updated and completed treatment analyses of the __ATAC__ trial represent the results of the largest trial to report to date and provide information on efficacy and tolerability 22 , 23 and 24. The __ATAC__ completed treatment analysis reinforces the results of the first and updated analyses and demonstrates that anastrozole provides superior efficacy to tamoxifen for __DFS__ , __TTR__ , time to distant recurrence and incidence in contralateral breast cancer .
In 2004 , the __ASCO__ Health Services Research Committee panel reviewed their guidelines on the adjuvant therapy of hormone-sensitive early operable breast cancer .
For the first time the __ASCO__ panel recommended that 5 years of tamoxifen alone is no longer the optimal adjuvant treatment and that the preferred treatment should include the use of an AI to reduce the risk of tumour recurrence .
The __ASCO__ panel supports the use of evidence-based medicine and recommends giving the AI with the best available data for a particular patient and setting .
The robust efficacy and safety data recorded in the __ATAC__ trial , including more than 5 years follow-up , indicate that anastrozole should be the primary option for initial adjuvant therapy .
Only anastrozole has established efficacy and safety data as initial therapy , with over 5 years long-term follow-up .
It must be noted that the __ATAC__ completed treatment analysis ( 68 months ) , the __BIG__ 1-98 data and the ABSCG 8 / ARNO 95 data , were not included in the __ASCO__ decision .
Guidelines from the Eighth International Breast Cancer Study Group meeting ( St. Gallen , Switzerland ) state that tamoxifen is the preferred option but highlight the use of anastrozole for patients intolerant to tamoxifen or when tamoxifen is contraindicated .
The existing St Gallen Consensus Guidelines are now 2 years old and were based only on data from the __ATAC__ trial at 47 months follow-up .
The __NCCN__ Practice Guidelines , 2005 , specify which of the __AIs__ to use in each setting and recommends using the drug with the best available data .
The __NCCN__ reviewed data from the __ATAC__ , __ITA__ , __IES__ and MA 17 trials .
In postmenopausal women with breast cancer the __NCCN__ recommends 5 years of anastrozole as initial adjuvant therapy or , after an initial 2 - 3 years tamoxifen , switching to anastrozole for a completed course of 5 years of hormonal therapy .
In previously premenopausal patients who have become postmenopausal after an initial 2 - 3 years tamoxifen the __NCCN__ recommends switching to anastrozole .
Given that the recent MA 17 extended adjuvant letrozole trial was terminated early , the results , although promising , are unlikely to result in future changes to advisory guidelines .
Furthermore , while this study is of interest to patients about to complete 5 years of tamoxifen , it does not address the issue of optimal adjuvant therapy .
Women with early breast cancer are at their greatest risk of disease recurrence during the first 5 years after initial diagnosis and treatment received during the first 5 years is therefore paramount to successful outcomes .
Data obtained from the __ATAC__ trial suggest that anastrozole is more effective than tamoxifen in reducing disease recurrence in postmenopausal women during this 5 year period and therefore it is reasonable to expect that anastrozole may replace tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy of choice in the short to medium term .
Furthermore , a recent re-analysis of the __ATAC__ data based on hazard rates at 6 monthly intervals demonstrates a dramatic flattening of the peak hazard for the anastrozole treated group compared with that seen in the tamoxifen group at 2 years , strengthening the argument in favour of starting the AI immediately after surgery rather than waiting for 2 years to pass .
A biological model that explains these observations was coincidently published a short time before they appeared in press .
Despite the continued use of tamoxifen , trials are now being initiated with anastrozole as the control arm , clearly demonstrating that anastrozole is increasingly being seen as standard treatment in the adjuvant setting for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer .
Indeed , data from the __ATAC__ and __BIG__ 1-98 trials provide substantial evidence that tamoxifen should no longer be viewed as the standard of care for adjuvant therapy of postmenopausal women .
The higher rates of recurrence , adverse events and withdrawals from treatment with tamoxifen , and the substantial benefit of anastrozole over the first 3 years , justify the approach of offering the most effective therapy at the earliest opportunity .
However , a benefit of long-term AI treatment on overall survival compared with tamoxifen is not expected at this stage as it took at least 7 years to show a significant survival advantage for tamoxifen versus placebo in previous adjuvant studies .
The optimal sequence in which treatments are given , as well as the optimal duration of therapy , is paramount to achieving maximal patient benefit .
Emerging switching data 45 , 46 and 47 , which strengthen the balance of superiority of anastrozole over tamoxifen , and further follow-up survival data for anastrozole will undoubtedly influence future changes to regulatory guidelines , as will a number of other ongoing clinical trials .
It is essential therefore that patients are notified of the results , and the limitations of existing and emerging data so that they are able to make informed decisions when faced with endocrine treatment choices .
