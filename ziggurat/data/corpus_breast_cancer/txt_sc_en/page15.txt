Introduction
Cyclin D1 is the product of the CCND1 ( PRAD1 ) gene located on chromosome 11q13 and is amplified in some 15% of breast cancers.1 and 2 However , cyclin D1 is overexpressed at the mRNA and protein level in over 50% of the breast cancers in the presence or absence of gene amplification2 and 3 and qualifies as one of the most commonly overexpressed proteins in breast cancer .
The stimulation of growth-arrested cells in response to various oncogenes such as ras , myc , E1A4 , 5 and 6 and mitogenic growth factors such as members of EGF , IGF families result in the induction of the D-type cyclins.7 These cyclins link the extracellular signals to the cell-cycle machinery8 and of the three D-type cyclins , it is cyclin D1 that is predominantly associated with human tumorigenesis.9
Cyclin D1 and cell-cycle regulation
Normal cell cycle
The p16 - cyclinD1 - __CDK4__ - Rb pathway is central to the regulation of the G1 - S phase transition in the cell cycle and alteration or mutation of one of the components of this pathway is encountered in most human cancers , the most prominent being cyclin D1.10 , 11 and 12 G1 cyclins ( cyclins D and E ) control the progression through the restriction point during late-G1 phase when cells lose their dependency on mitogens and commit to DNA synthesis.13
Class D cyclins ( D1 , D2 and D3 ) bind to CDKs 4 and 6 and phosphorylate various substrates including Rb protein.14 The partial phosphorylation ( inactivation ) of Rb results in liberation of the transcription factors , predominantly the ones belonging to E2F family , which in turn activate various genes responsible for progression of S phase.15 The cyclin E1 gene is an E2F target and this results in induction of cyclin E1 protein in mid-to late-G1 phase , which in turn complexes with CDK2 and completes the phosphorylation of Rb.16 and 17 This creates a positive feedback loop and contributes to the irreversibility of the G1 / S transition.18 p16INK4a protein is a negative regulator of the catalytic activity of CDK419 and forms a key regulatory protein in cell-cycle progression .
In addition to Rb phosphorylation , the cyclin D - __CDK4__ complex sequesters __CDKI__ including p27kip1 and p21cip1,20 which in turn facilitates activation of cyclin E - CDK2 activation later in G1 phase .
Deviation from normal
The oncogenic capacity of cyclin D1 has been established in various studies.21 , 22 and 23 It has been shown that the induction of cyclin D1 in breast cancer cell lines shortens G1 and results in an increase in the number of cells progressing through G1.24 This observation is supported by other studies demonstrating entry into S phase is prevented by inhibiting cyclin D1 expression,25 and 26 thereby suggesting that cyclin D1 is essential for G1 progresssion .
Moreover , cyclin D1 , along with cyclin E , is rate-limiting for progress through G1 in various cell lines ; cyclin D1 in early G1 and cyclin E in late G1 phase of the cell cycle.7 , 24 and 25
Cyclin D1 plays a pivotal role in oestrogen-induced breast cancer with oestrogen action mediated through transcriptional activation of cyclin D1 and c-myc.27 , 28 and 29 This evidence suggests a critical role for cyclin D1 in human breast cancer cell-cycle control .
Given this role , overexpression of cyclin D1 may provide a growth advantage to the tumour cells and may also contribute towards resistance to endocrine therapy.24
Non-cell cycle associated CDK-independent function of cyclin D1 ( cyclin D1 as a transcriptional regulator )
Cyclin D1 can regulate the growth of oestrogen-responsive tissues by activating the oestrogen receptor ( __ER__ ) in a ligand-independent fashion , i.e. in the absence of oestrogen.30 Cyclin D1 binds to the hormone-binding domain of __ER__ and promotes association between __ER__ and one of its coactivators resulting in upregulation of ER-mediated transcription through a CDK-independent mechanism.30 and 31 This oestrogen-independent ER-agonistic activity of cyclin D1 could underlie its oncogenic role in ER-positive breast cancer .
Transactivation by __ER__ depends on binding of a leucine-rich motif present in the transactivation domain , AF-2 to the steroid receptor coactivators and this binding is ligand-regulated.32 and 33 The co-activators then recruit additional transcriptional factors , p300 / CBP ( p300 / CREB-binding protein ) and P / CAF ( p300 / CREB-binding protein-associated protein ) , which attach to __ER__ and also interact with each other34 to promote transcription by virtue of their inherent histone acetyltransferase activity.35 It has been shown that cyclin D1 can interact with coactivators of the SRC-1 family and act as a bridging factor between __ER__ and SRCs , thereby transactivating __ER__ in the absence of the oestrogen ligand .
A leucine-rich domain in the carboxy terminus of cyclin D1 is responsible for the interaction with SRC.36 Similarly , it has been demonstrated that cyclin D1 can interact with another transcriptional factor , P / CAF facilitating an association between P / CAF and __ER__ ; which in turn potentiates transcriptional activation by __ER__ via its histone acetyltransferase activity.37
More recent studies have shown that cyclin D1 can interact with variety of transcription factors such as androgen receptor , DMP1 , C / EBPÃŸ and histone acetylases and deacetylases independent of CDKs17 and 38 suggesting a role as a transcriptional regulator in addition to the well-established CDK-dependent role in cell-cycle progression .
Cyclin D1 and oestrogen
The mitogenic effects of oestradiol ( E2 ) are mediated by at least two E2 target genes , c-myc39 and cyclin D1,29 , 40 and 41 each working independently.27 Of the two regulatory genes , myc is activated earlier by E2 than cyclin D1 in the G1 phase.42 These pathways converge at the activation of cyclin E - CDK2 complexes .
The active cyclin E - CDK2 complexes are depleted of the __CDKI__ p21cip1 being sequestered by cyclin D1.20 Phosphorylation of pRB ( retinoblastoma ) follows in response to activation of cyclin E - CDK2 and cyclin D - __CDK4__ complexes , resulting in the release of transcription factors necessary for DNA synthesis and progression from G1 to S phase of the cell cycle.28 and 43
While __ER__ -mediated signalling pathway by __ER__ is not known to contain an ERE region in its promoter44 and 45 and its transcriptional activation is probably mediated through protein - protein interactions via a cAMP response element located close to the transcription start site .
However , the role of additional non-ER pathway ( s ) have als__ROS__ .47 and 48 Recently , it has been suggested that E2-induced mitochondrial __ROS__ play a role in G1 / S progression of oestrogen-stimulated breast cancer cells via activation of the transcription factor AP-1 , which is known to be involved in the transcription of cyclin D1 .
Mitochondrial function blockade halted E2-induced cell-cycle progression , accompanied by decreased expression of cyclins D and E , suggesting that in addition to __ER__ signalling pathway , E2-induced mitochondrial __ROS__ contribute to G1 / S phase progression of oestrogen-stimulated breast cancer cells.46
Cyclin D1 in mammary gland development and carcinogenesis
Mammary gland development during pregnancy is impaired in cyclin D1 knockout mice.49 and 50 However , development is normal if the inhibitory effect of CDKs is removed by inducing p27kip1 deficiency in cyclin D1 null mice51 or if cyclin D1 is replaced by cyclin E1 , which is a downstream target of cyclin D1.52 Tissue-specific expression of cyclin D1 in transgenic mice results in mammary hyperplasia and adenocarcinoma,23 though the carcinoma developed after a latent period suggesting the need of cooperation with other genetic events .
Furthermore , cyclin D1-deficient mice are resistant to mammary carcinomas induced by c-neu / Her-2 and ras oncogenes , but not those induced by c-myc and Wnt-1 , suggesting that ras and c-neu signal via cyclin D1 to promote carcinogenesis.53 However , evidence from studies on human breast cancer provides conflicting information .
For example , cyclin D1 overexpression correlates with ER-positive status , whereas breast tumours overexpressing Her-2 are predominantly ER-negative.54 and 55 Although , __ADH__ is infrequently associated with cyclin D1 overexpression in human cohort studies,56 and 57 overexpression of cyclin D1 is seen in 50 - 80% cases of DCIS56 , 57 and 58 suggesting a role in human breast carcinogenesis .
It was initially believed that a CDK-dependent function of cyclin D1 resulted in progression through G1 phase and thus enhanced cellular proliferation lay behind its oncogenic potential .
However , evidence from various clinical studies fails to support this hypothesis and therefore an alternative CDK-independent function resulting in tumorigenesis has been suggested.59
( a ) Breast cancers overexpressing cyclin D1 do not show high levels of its downstream product , cyclin E involved in the CDK-dependent pathway involving Rb and E2F transcription factors .60 and 61
( b ) Tumours overexpressing cyclin D1 exhibit relatively normal rate of proliferation , whereas the ones with overexpression of cyclin E or pRb defects show a high proliferation index.61 and 62
( c ) Cyclin D1 levels do not correlate with Ki-67 expression , a marker of cellular proliferation.63
( d ) Moreover , cyclin D1 is predominantly expressed in well-differentiated , low-grade , and slow growing breast cancers64 and 65 suggesting the possibility that cyclin D1 may also be involved in cell differentiation and growth arrest66 in addition to its well documented role in cell-cycle progression .
Since cyclin D1 is overexpressed preferentially in ER-positive breast cancer , it has been suggested that modulation of transcription via its action on __ER__ probably underlies the oncogenic activity of cyclin D1 in breast cancer.30 and 36 This hypothesis is supported by the findings that show the direct interaction between cyclin D1 and __ER__ , which in turn activates ER-regulated genes in the absence of oestrogen.67
Cyclin D1 and breast cancer
Cyclin D1 overexpression has been reported between 40 and 90% of cases of invasive breast cancer , while gene amplification is seen in about 5 - 20% of tumours.2 , 56 , 60 and 68 Though CCND1 amplification correlates well with the overexpression of the protein,69 and 70 high expression of cyclin D1 is not always secondary to gene amplification implying that other mechanisms contribute to maintain cyclin D1 overexpression .
Various factors that could contribute to protein overexpression in breast cancer include oestrogen7 and 29 and p53 through p21cip1 pathway71 .
Correlation with tumour markers
__ER__ and PgR
Cyclin D1 expression correlates strongly with __ER__ and PgR levels in breast cancer.60 , 62 , 68 , 72 and 73 However , a variable association has been reported by different studies between CCND1 amplification and __ER__ status .
While the majority report a positive association,74 , 75 , 76 and 77 some did not observe any link.73
p53 and p21
No association has been found between the expression of p53 and its downstream effectors such as p21 and cyclin D1 overexpression in clinical studies73 though this contradicts the experimental data that suggests that cyclin D1 expression can be regulated by p53 through p21.71
Evaluation of immunohistochemical staining
Cyclin D1 nuclear intensity on immunohistochemistry has been linked to the degree of amplification of CCND1.68 Recently , a positive link has also been suggested between intensity of staining and resistance to tamoxifen treatment78 suggesting that the intensity of staining and labelling index , should be recorded separately in immunohistochemical studies of cyclin D1 .
Gene amplification and co-amplifications
CCND1 is amplified in 15 - 20% of breast cancer patients and this can be detected by the __FISH__ technique using commercially available probes .
This gene amplification may be reflected in the intensity of staining on immunohistochemistry68 and 70 .
The co-amplification of one or several oncogenes such as CCND1 , HER2 , mdm2 , myc , EGFR occurs commonly in breast cancer , reported in up to 30% of CCND1- and up to 40% of HER2-amplified cancers.79 In patients with CCND1 / HER2 co-amplification , the prognosis relates to HER2 amplification and the impact of CCND1 amplification appears minimal while with other co-amplifications such as HER2 / myc , the effect is additive .
Prognostic value
Published evidence suggest that overexpression of cyclin D1 is a good prognostic factor in invasive breast cancer associated with better patient outcome ( overall survival and relapse-free survival ) particularly for ER-positive patients,64 , 80 and 81 although one study disagrees with this.82 Conversely , gene amplification relates to early relapse and poor prognosis in ER-positive breast cancer.68 , 76 and 83 This controversy about different prognostic value of the protein and the gene stems from the lack of studies assessing the two variables in the same set of patients .
This conflict becomes more relevant in the light of available evidence suggesting that CCND1 amplification correlates well with cyclin D1 overexpression.69 However a recent study has looked at the two variables in the same patient group70 and has suggested that both predict poor response to tamoxifen therapy in ER-positive breast cancer .
The prognostic value of cyclin D1 overexpression with regards to recurrence and overall survival needs to be ascertained by further studies .
Response to antioestrogens
Antioestrogens inhibit breast cancer cell proliferation by blocking the entry of cells into S phase.84 This is mediated by an early decline in pRB phosphorylation effected by down regulation of CDK activity due to down regulation of oestrogen-dependent cyclin D1 expression.85 Later , an increase in __CDKI__ p27kip1 and p21cip1 maintain repression of CDK activity.86 and 87
The molecular action of cyclin D1 could be mediated either through its partial ER-agonist effect30 or via its ability to sequester __CDKI__ during G1 / S transition resulting in propagation of cell proliferation.20 and 88 In addition , both cyclin D1 over-expression and gene amplification have recently been shown to predict poor response to anti-oestrogen therapy in ER-positive breast cancer patients.70 and 78 Studies of breast cancer cell lines suggested that the ectopic overexpression of cyclin D1 reverses the anti-proliferative effect of antioestrogens,87 though some contradictory results have also been reported.89 However , clinical studies of tamoxifen as an adjuvant therapy in ER-positive breast cancer show a higher response and better survival rate in cancers with cyclin D1 low / moderate expression than those with high expression of cyclin D1.70 and 78 This association was noted within 2 years of initiating adjuvant tamoxifen treatment and may be an underlying reason for the failure of anti-oestrogen therapy in some tumours despite them being ER-positive .
Cyclin D1 gene amplification is a stronger predictor of tamoxifen response than protein expression , though the latter has a significant correlation.70 One small study did not observe a relationship between cyclin D1 expression and response of bony metastases to tamoxifen therapy.90 This implies that evaluation of expression of cyclin D1 could assist in determining optimal adjuvant therapy in addition to it being a prognostic variable in ER-positive breast cancer .
Currently , there is no evidence available to suggest if cyclin D1 overexpression has any association with response to aromatase inhibitors .
Response to radiotherapy
Experimental evidence suggests that cyclin D1-overexpression in breast cancer cell lines increases sensitivity to ionizing radiation.91 Enhanced apoptotic response was observed after MCF-7 cells with cyclin D1 overexpression were exposed to radiation , thought to be due to sustained high levels of p53 and p21 after their initial induction by the radiation , the mechanism of which is unclear .
Therapeutic value
A recent experimental study has reported modulation of MCF-7 cell line growth rate by regulated overexpression or suppression of endogenous cyclin D1 or __CDK4__ levels,92 suggesting cyclin D1 - __CDK4__ may be a target in cancer therapeutics .
Together , the knowledge that the p16INK4a - cyclin D1 - __CDK4__ - Rb axis is a commonly altered pathway in human cancers , the increasing evidence of a role for cyclin D1 in oncogenesis ( thus qualifying as a proto-oncogene ) and the recent discovery of __CDK4__ inhibitors,93 and 94 CDK4-dependent Rb phosphorylation could potentially be a future target of anticancer drugs .
Conclusions
CCND1 is an oestrogen-responsive gene and carries an oncogenic potential by actions influencing cell-cycle regulation at the G1 / S phase transition and transcriptional regulation .
Its product , cyclin D1 is overexpressed in more than half of invasive breast cancers .
Recent evidence suggests that cyclin D1 interferes with the effect of tamoxifen and ER-positive breast cancers with cyclin D1 overexpression could potentially account for treatment failure while on tamoxifen therapy .
The current data suggests that cyclin D1 merits further investigations as a marker of disease response and prognosis and offers future therapeutic opportunities .
