Compared with other common malignancies , breast cancer in women has a relatively good prognosis in the short and medium term .
Where long-term survival has been examined , it has mostly been shown that women with breast cancer continue to experience excess mortality into the second and third decades after their diagnosis .
This excess mortality may be due to the existence of micro-metastases - disseminated cancer cells present even in women with apparently localised disease at diagnosis .
Because previous survival studies have been based on cohort or complete approaches , trends in long-term survival have involved women diagnosed from the 1940s up to the 1970s , at least 10 years before the important advances in diagnosis and management that occurred during the 1980s .
We have used statistical methods designed to reflect the recent gains in short-term survival , to provide the most up-to-date predictions of long-term survival possible , namely for women diagnosed in England and Wales during the period 1971-2001 and followed up to 2003 .
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data were obtained from the Office for National Statistics on all women diagnosed in England and Wales with invasive breast cancer in 1971-2001 and followed up until 31 December 2003 .
To these , we applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria recently reported , before estimating relative survival up to 20 years after diagnosis .
Relative survival estimates the disease-specific survival by subtracting the background general population mortality from the overall mortality observed among the cancer patients .
It is the most defensible method of examining long-term disease survival , because it does not rely upon accurate reporting of cause of death .
We used both period and hybrid approaches to estimate relative survival and they are contrasted with the classical cohort approach in Figure 1.
The period approach derives the most up-to-date estimates of survival by incorporating the probabilities of death derived from the most recent year or period for which follow-up data are available , while excluding survival probabilities derived from earlier periods ( left censoring ) .
The calculation of period survival is analogous to that of life expectancy at birth from a period life table. It was used to produce sets of estimates of long-term survival for women with breast cancer who were alive at some point either during the period 1991-1993 or during 1996-1998 .
These period survival estimates are best interpreted as the predicted probability of survival for a patient diagnosed within those periods .
Hybrid analysis is a modification of the period approach that combines both cohort and period techniques .
It is preferable in scenarios where information on the patients vital status becomes available more rapidly than the reporting of incident cases , because it enables unbiased estimates of survival ; it was applied for the period 1999-2003 .
Cohort survival estimates from the first and second years of follow-up for women diagnosed during 1999-2001 were combined with period estimates of relative survival for the third to twentieth years of follow-up observed among women alive at any point during the interval 2001-2003 .
Relative survival rates were all estimated with a maximum likelihood approach for individual tumour data using the algorithm strel ( Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group , 2006 ) implemented in STATAÃ” ( StataCorp , 2006 ) .
Background mortality was taken from period- and deprivation-specific national life tables in every analysis ( Cancer Research UK Cancer Survival Group , 2004 ) .
Survival estimates were derived for all women aged 15-99 years at diagnosis , and separately for the three broad age groups 15-49 , 50-69 and 70-99 years .
Changes in survival over a 10 year period were derived from a variance-weighted linear regression of survival estimates for the periods 1991-1993 , 1996-1998 and 1999-2003 .
Overall survival estimates for all women aged 15-99 years at diagnosis were age-standardised using the population structure of women diagnosed with breast cancer in England and Wales during the period 1986-1990 , to enable comparison with published data .
RESULTS
Overall predicted long-term survival has improved markedly since 1991-1993 , with a 17-20% improvement in predicted 10- and 20 year relative survival over the 10 year interval from 1991-1993 to 1999-2003 .
The predicted improvement in long-term survival was better for women aged 50 and over at diagnosis ( 18-24% ) , than for those aged 15-49 years ( 13-14% ) .
Overall 10 year relative survival , for all women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in England and Wales between 1999 and 2003 in the age range 15-99 years , is predicted to exceed 72% .
More than 64% of recently diagnosed women are predicted to survive to the 20th anniversary of their diagnosis .
In 1991-1993 , women diagnosed at ages 15-49 years had higher predicted 10- , 15- and 20 year survival than older women , but a decade later , their predicted survival was lower than for women diagnosed aged 50-69 years .
By contrast , 1 year survival rates and trends were very similar in these age groups ( data not shown ) .
Older women ( 70-99 years ) experienced the lowest survival , particularly 10 years after diagnosis ( 63% ) .
However , although the difference between 10- and 20 year survival was similar for all three age groups among women diagnosed in 1991-1993 ( about 10% ) , the difference was less marked among older women diagnosed since 1999 .
This reflects the larger recent increase in long-term survival among women aged 50 and over than among those aged 15-49 years .
DISCUSSION
This study predicts substantial increases in long-term survival from invasive breast cancer among women diagnosed over the period 1991-2003 , particularly for those aged 50 years or more .
It also shows persisting excess mortality up to at least 20 years after diagnosis .
We have previously documented large and continuing improvements in survival in England and Wales over this period using conventional approaches .
This study extends those reports by providing predictions of long-term survival for women diagnosed very recently , as well as demonstrating how this predicted survival has changed over time .
The rising trend in long-term survival in breast cancer in England and Wales probably reflects the combined impact of several important changes in its diagnosis and management over the last two decades .
These include the widespread adoption of adjuvant chemotherapy , as recommended by the 1985 world overview , the increasing use of hormonal-based treatments in England and Wales , particularly for post-menopausal women , the use of radiotherapy after breast-conserving surgery ( Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group , 2005 ) and the establishment of the National Health Service Breast Screening Programme for women aged 50-64 years in 1988 .
In this period-based approach , the survival improvements described reflect the impact of very recent changes in breast cancer management upon short-term survival , combined with the impact of less recent changes upon longer-term survival .
Consequently , although the survival rates reported here are more up-to-date than conventional estimates , even period estimates cannot yet reflect the full potential impact of recent advances in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer on long-term survival , because women contributing to the survival estimates for the 15th to 20th years of follow-up were diagnosed before those advances were made .
A further 5-10 years of incidence and follow-up data will enable the impact of these changes in diagnosis and management upon very long-term survival to be formally assessed .
Comparing the 10 year survival rates with those estimated for 15-20 years after diagnosis shows that relative survival for breast cancer continues to decrease throughout the two decades following diagnosis .
This is consistent both with early work , and with a more recent analysis of women diagnosed with breast cancer in Finland up to 1999 .
Our data further suggest that this tendency applies to women diagnosed as recently as 1981 and that it has not diminished over time , although it is not yet possible to assess the impact of the changes implemented during the late 1980s upon survival beyond 15 years after diagnosis .
Our study highlights the much better prognosis for women diagnosed in the first few years of the twenty-first century than for women diagnosed during the early 1990s .
However , the continued existence of late mortality from breast cancer suggests that the treatments given for breast cancer , at least up to the mid-to-late 1980s , have not yet eliminated the continuing risk of death due to the disease more than 10 years after initial diagnosis .
