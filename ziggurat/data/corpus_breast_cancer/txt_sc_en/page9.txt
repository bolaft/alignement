Introduction
Breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer in the world today with about 3.9 million women diagnosed to have breast cancer within the last 5 years alive today.1 Once metastatic disease has been diagnosed , the disease is generally not curable.2 Worldwide , the ratio of incidence to mortality is 36% , with 370,000 annual deaths representing 13.9% of cancer deaths in women.1
Treatment of __MBC__ with chemotherapy and endocrine therapy has progressively improved over the last few decades. Many chemotherapeutic and endocrine agents are now licensed for use in __MBC__ and form the mainstay of treatment for this disease.5 Chemotherapy has been shown to improve symptoms and survival in these patients .
Successive lines of chemotherapy in the setting of __MBC__ have been shown to have lower __RR__ .9 __RR__ for chemotherapy in a third line setting is in the context of small phase II studies and ranges from 0% to 38%. Multiple lines of chemotherapy are now frequently offered to patients with __MBC__ but these treatments are toxic and resource intensive and the extent to which this achieves clinical benefit in terms of __RR__ , __RR__ and survival is unclear .
We have therefore audited the outcomes of third line chemotherapy for __MBC__ in our institution and we have tried to identify factors that predict these outcomes .
Materials and methods
Population
All patients with __MBC__ who received third line chemotherapy over a seven year period ( July 1998 - July 2005 ) at the Royal Marsden Hospital were studied .
The data relating to the dose of chemotherapy , dates of administration , radiological assessment , __TTP__ and survival were retrieved from a prospectively maintained electronic patient database at the hospital .
The study proposal were reviewed and approved by our Institutional Audit Committee .
Definitions
For the purpose of analysis patients were classified as having a response if the best response to treatment was a complete response or a partial response on radiological or clinical assessment .
Patients who had stable disease or progressive disease as a best response were considered to be nonresponders .
__TTP__ and survival were defined as time to radiological or clinical progression and time to death after the commencement of chemotherapy , respectively .
For analysis , 5FU+vinorelbine was classified as fluropyrimidine combinations , epirubicin+vinorelbine and AC were classified as anthracycline combinations , MVP , MVCarbo and gemcitabine+carboplatin were classified as platinum combinations .
Variables
Variables studied included age , oestrogen receptor ( ER ) status , Her-2 status , response to first and second line of chemotherapy , class of chemotherapy agents used , endocrine therapy and trastuzumab treatment and sites of disease .
Statistical analysis
Multivariate analysis using a Cox regression was used to study factors influencing response , __TTP__ and survival .
Differences in __RR__ between subgroups of patients were calculated by chi-square tests .
Differences in __TTP__ and survival were calculated by the method of Kaplan Meier by means of the log rank test .
Results
Patient demographics
The patient characteristics are summarized in Table 1. One hundred and forty nine female patients with __MBC__ who received third line chemotherapy between June 1998 and June 2005 were studied .
The median age was 52 yrs ( range 25 - 80 yrs ) .
Sites of visceral , bone , CNS and skin metastases were 96% , 63% , 34% and 31% , respectively .
Fifty-six percent of patients were ER positive and 34% were Her-2 positive .
A majority of patients had received adjuvant treatment ( 70% chemotherapy and 67% hormonal treatment ) .
Only 15% of patients had not been exposed to an anthracycline or a taxane prior to having third line chemotherapy .
Multivariate analysis of factors influencing the outcome of patients receiving third line chemotherapy for __MBC__ demonstrated that of the variables studied , only response to previous chemotherapy independently predicted for __RR__ , __TTP__ and survival , p=0.025 , 0.04 and 0.004 , respectively .
All other factors studied , i.e. age , site of metastasis , ER status , Her-2 status and class of chemotherapeutic agent used , endocrine therapy and trastuzumab treatment were not statistically significant independent variables .
Response to previous chemotherapy
The overall __RR__ , median __TTP__ and survival of all patients studied was 30% ( 95% CI 22.9 - 38.3 ) , 4 months ( 95% CI 3.4 - 4.6 ) and 8 months ( 95% CI 6.2 - 9.8 ) , respectively .
Three subgroups of patients were identified .
Group I ( 31 / 149 ) responded to the first and second lines of chemotherapy and had a __RR__ of 45% ( 95% CI 27.3 - 64 ) with a __TTP__ of 4 months ( 95% CI 1.4 - 6.6 ) and a survival of 12 months ( 95% CI 5.9 - 18.1 ) .
Group II included patients who had responded to the one but not both the first two lines of chemotherapy ( 69 / 149 ) and had a __RR__ , __TTP__ and survival of 30% ( 95% CI 19.9 - 42.7 ) , 4 months ( 95% CI 2.9 - 5.1 ) and 8 months ( 95% CI 6.2 - 9.8 ) .
Group III included patients who did not respond to either first or second line of chemotherapy ( 49 / 149 ) .
These patients had a __RR__ of 20% ( 95% CI 10.2 - 34.3 ) , __TTP__ of 3 months ( 95% CI 2 - 4 ) and survival of 6 months ( 95% CI 4.7 - 7.3 ) .
Patients responding to the first two lines of chemotherapy were compared to those who did not ( group I vs group II+group III ) .
These patients had a significantly better __RR__ 45% ( 95% CI 27.3 - 64 ) vs 26% ( 95% CI 18.6 - 35.2 ) , p=0.004 , __TTP__ 4 months ( 95% CI 1.4 - 6.6 ) vs 4 months ( 95% CI 3.3 - 4.7 ) , p=0.041 and survival 12 months ( 95% CI 5.9 - 18 ) vs 8 months ( 95% CI 6.3 - 9.7 ) , p=0.0018 .
Patients who did not respond to the both first and second lines of chemotherapy were compared to those who responded to either one or both lines of chemotherapy ( group III vs group I+group II ) .
This group of patients had a lower __RR__ 20% ( 95% CI 10.2 - 34.3 ) vs 35% ( 95% CI 25.7 - 45.2 ) but this was statistically not significant , p=0.068 .
However , this group of patients did have a significantly shorter median __TTP__ , 3 months ( 95% CI 2 - 4 ) vs 4 months ( 95% CI 3.1 - 4.9 ) , p=0.033 and shorter median survival , 6 months ( 95% CI 4.7 - 7.3 ) vs 9 months ( 95% CI 6.9 - 11.1 ) , p=0.027 .
Patients who responded to the first or second line of chemotherapy ( group II ) when compared to those who responded to both lines of chemotherapy ( group I ) did not have a significantly worse __RR__ or __TTP__ , p=0.15 and 0.13 , respectively .
They did , however , have a significantly worse survival ( 8 months ( 95% CI 6.2 - 9.8 ) vs 12 months ( 95% CI 5.9 - 18.1 ) , p=0.01 .
Patients in group II did not have a significantly different __RR__ , __TTP__ or survival when compared to patients in group III , p=0.22 , 0.13 and 0.36 , respectively .
Discussion
Patients with __MBC__ who are symptomatic but fit are increasingly offered third line chemotherapy and this has been the policy at our institution .
Published reports on __RR__ , __TTP__ and survival in this setting are based on data derived from small phase II trials ( 10 - 18 ) .
The data derived from our study are based on a relatively large number of patients receiving a wide range of chemotherapeutic agents and could be used as a benchmark against which novel chemotherapeutic agents used in this setting should be compared .
Response to chemotherapy in __MBC__ has shown to predict for survival. It has also been shown that successive lines of chemotherapy for __MBC__ have progressively lower RR.9 Response to previous chemotherapy was the only factor that independently predicted for __RR__ , __TTP__ and survival in our study .
Patients in our cohort who responded to the first two lines of chemotherapy ( group I ) had significantly better __RR__ , __TTP__ and survival compared to those who did not and this supports the use of third line chemotherapy in this subgroup .
Conversely , approximately a third ( 32% ) of our patients did not respond to the first two lines of chemotherapy ( group III ) and had a significantly shorter __TTP__ and survival .
These findings support offering this subset of patient 's clinical trials with novel agents or supportive care .
The group of patients with an intermediate prognosis who responded to only one of the two first lines of chemotherapy ( group II ) did not have a significantly worse __RR__ or __TTP__ compared to group I and our view is that this group of patients should be offered third line chemotherapy if they have a satisfactory performance status .
An important finding of our study was that the class of chemotherapeutic agents or combinations used did not independently predict for __RR__ , __TTP__ or survival .
This suggests that patients who do not respond to chemotherapy might have common mechanisms of drug resistance such as P-glycoprotein expression.
Age has previously been reported to independently influence outcome of chemotherapy for __MBC__ but our observations did not support this .
Performance status was not reliably recorded in this retrospective audit and thus not studied .
Negative ER status has been shown to predict a superior response to chemotherapy in breast cancer , but again ER status was not an independent variable in our study .
Treatment with endocrine agents and the number of lines of endocrine treatment used for __MBC__ were not independent variables in this study .
It has been suggested that Her-2 positive tumours may have an increased sensitivity to anthracyclines while other studies have noted that Her-2 status may negatively influence outcome of breast cancer to chemotherapy.31 Her-2 positivity did not predict __RR__ , __TTP__ or survival of patients receiving third line chemotherapy at our institution .
Treatment with Trastuzumab did not significantly influence outcomes of patients treated with third line chemotherapy .
The presence of visceral metastases has been variably reported to predict32 or not to predict33 response to chemotherapy in __MBC__ .
Since 96% of patients had visceral metastases we were unable to clarify this further .
Conclusion
In conclusion our audit has shown that third line chemotherapy for __MBC__ can provide effective palliative benefit in patients who have responded to one or two prior chemotherapy schedules .
Patients failing to respond to either of two prior lines of chemotherapy did significantly worse and should be considered for treatment in clinical trials or supportive care .
These results could be used as a benchmark for comparison with trials with novel therapeutic agents used in the same setting .
