Introduction
Women with primary breast cancer usually undergo breast surgery plus adjuvant systemic treatments in order to reduce the risks of local and distant disease recurrence , but with the potential for multiple effects on __QOL__ .
The overall psychosocial impact of these modern treatments has been reported. Younger patients are more likely to suffer adverse effects because of induction of an early menopause and possible infertility .
Other reported problems have included poor sexual functioning , altered body image , fatigue and difficulty with shoulder and arm movements .
These effects may have an impact on __QOL__ in the longer term .
Radiotherapy is known to have late effects on normal tissues which could contribute adversely to body image and related __QOL__ parameters but it is often impossible to attribute __QOL__ effects , such as breast symptoms , to a specific adjuvant strategy in multimodal therapy. Ganz and colleagues commented that women are generally well prepared for the acute toxicities of breast cancer treatments but that clinicians have limited information on the physical and psychosocial sequelae of primary treatments , or the pattern of recovery .
This highlights the need for more precise data on individual treatment effects and interactions.16
The __QOL__ protocol in the __START__ trial will help address these deficiencies , through its prospective design and long term follow-up , by using patient assessed measures of body image and __QOL__ , and by identifying the effects of individual treatments in multimodal therapy .
The trial includes women of all ages allowing the effect of age on __QOL__ to be explored .
The purpose of the trial is to test the effects of radiotherapy fractions >2.0 Gy on local tumour control and late normal tissue response in the breast area after tumour excision .
The trial comprises two randomised comparisons , namely Trial A , which tests three fractionation schedules ; 50 Gy in 25 fractions ( F ) over 5 weeks versus two dose levels of a test schedule giving 41.6 Gy or 39 Gy in 13 F over 5 weeks , and Trial B , which tests the standard therapy ( 50 Gy in 25 F ) against a dose level of 40 Gy in 15 F over 3 weeks.17 Long-term follow-up is now being completed and __QOL__ will form part of the outcome assessment of the randomised comparison .
Over 2000 women ( >50% of trial participants ) have been accrued to the __QOL__ study , making this the largest such investigation in the UK .
Prior to breaking the randomisation code , we have undertaken this analysis to describe __QOL__ in the overall cohort of patients and to investigate the effects on __QOL__ of age and other primary treatments , prior to starting radiotherapy , in order to gauge the extent to which key domains such as body image may be affected by other primary treatments .
The size of the database allows us to explore the individual impact of type of surgery , __ET__ , __ET__ , as well as examining age effects , whilst controlling for time since surgery , on all __QOL__ domains .
Aims of baseline analysis
To describe all aspects of __QOL__ at baseline , i.e. prior to undergoing radiation therapy .
To determine the impact on __QOL__ of age , type of breast surgery ( Mx vs __WLE__ ) , adjuvant __CT__ and __ET__ whilst controlling for time elapsed since surgery .
These factors were selected to accurately determine the impact of primary breast cancer treatment on __QOL__ before radiotherapy , whilst taking account of the fact that patients undergoing __CT__ would have a longer time between breast surgery and radiotherapy compared with those proceeding directly to radiotherapy .
Age was included because it is known to influence some aspects of __QOL__ .
To compare women under 50 years with those aged greater-or-equal , slanted50 in terms of __QOL__ .
These age-groups were chosen to provide subgroups representing proxy pre- and post-menopausal status in the analysis at baseline .
Methods
Women prescribed postoperative radiotherapy for early breast cancer attending the 35 centres participating in the __START__ trial were eligible for the __QOL__ study .
A total of 4451 patients were recruited into the __START__ trial between 1999 and 2002 .
The protocol did not impose a limit on the time between surgery and randomisation into the trial , but there had to be a minimum of two weeks between the end of chemotherapy and the start of radiotherapy treatment .
Patients from 31 of the centres were recruited into the __QOL__ study , after obtaining written informed consent .
To avoid introducing bias from knowledge of randomised treatment allocation , baseline __QOL__ data were collected prior to randomisation into the __START__ trial , together with demographic data .
__QOL__ Measures
Standardized self-report __QOL__ measures were used , including the EORTC QLQ-C30,18 the EORTC BR23,19 the __BIS__ ,20 and the __BIS__ .21 These measures were selected as they had been used successfully in other national and European breast cancer trials , allowing comparison of results .
The QLQ-C30 is a 30 item multi dimensional cancer specific __QOL__ scale made up of 5 functional subscales ( physical , role , emotional , cognitive , and social functioning ) , together with 9 symptom subscales / items ( fatigue , nausea and vomiting , pain , dyspnoea , insomnia , appetite loss , constipation , diarrhoea , and financial difficulties ) .
Two further items assess global health and global quality of life .
The BR23 breast cancer module is designed to capture effects due to treatment .
Its 23 items are organised into four symptom scales ( systemic therapy side effects , breast symptoms , arm symptoms , and upset by hair loss ) and four functional subscales ( body image , sexual functioning , sexual enjoyment , and future perspective ) .
The BIS is a 10 item scale designed for use with cancer patients .
Items cover change in physical and sexual attractiveness , physical appearance when dressed and naked , satisfaction with the body and scars , body integrity and avoidance of people .
The BIS is widely used in national breast cancer trials and psychosocial studies .
The four body image items in BR23 were taken from the 10 item scale but there is no duplication of body image items in the __QOL__ assessment booklet .
The HADS is a 14 item scale designed for use in a medical setting .
It is the most widely used measure of psychological distress in cancer patients and has been used extensively in UK cancer therapy trials over many years .
It has the advantage over __QOL__ subscales that measure emotional functioning in providing an estimate of the clinical level of distress by applying threshold scores for normal , borderline or probable case levels of anxiety or depression .
Additional protocol specific symptom items were included to cover expected effects of radiotherapy and will be reported later .
Scoring and statistical analysis
EORTC QLQ-C30 and BR-23
All items were scored using a 4 point response scale , except for global health and global quality of life , for which a 7 point range was used .
For the functional and global health / QL subscales , higher scores indicate a better level of functioning , whereas for the symptom scales , higher scores represent more symptoms .
Summary scores were calculated according to the EORTC manual.22 Summary statistics were calculated for baseline scores , according to categories of type of surgery ( Mx , __WLE__ ) , time since surgery , __CT__ , __ET__ and age .
Subscale scores were compared between groups of patients defined according to age and the set of clinical variables tested using t-tests and __ANOVA__ as appropriate .
In order to investigate the effect of confounding on observed associations with __QOL__ scores , multiple regression was used , and the significance of variables tested using the F-test from an __ANOVA__ that included all relevant independent variables ( surgery , time since surgery , __CT__ , __ET__ and age ) .
Hence the p-values from the F-test indicate the significance of each variable after allowing for the effects of the other variables listed .
Variables which remain significant in the multiple regression can be said to have independent statistically significant effects on the outcome in question .
As the majority of trial participants did not require adjuvant __CT__ and because of the observed extensive effect of __CT__ on __QOL__ , the regression analysis was repeated including pair-wise interactions between __CT__ and the other independent variables .
A further subgroup analysis investigated associations between clinical variables and __QOL__ parameters separately for age <50 and greater-or-equal , slanted50 years , to differentiate between factors affecting pre- and post-menopausal women , respectively .
For all other analyses age was treated as a continuous variable .
Missing items have been scored according to EORTC QLQ-C30 scoring manual.22
__BIS__
The 10 BIS item scores from 0 ( none ) to 3 ( very much ) were summed to give an overall total between 0 ( best body image ) and 30 ( worst body image ) .
The same methods for describing data and inter-group comparison were used as above .
__HADS__
The HADS anxiety and depression subscale scores were categorised as 0 - 7 ( normal ) , 8 - 10 ( borderline anxious / depressed ) and greater-or-equal , slanted11 ( probable case anxiety / depression ) according to recommended thresholds. Comparisons between categories of the prognostic factors listed above were made using the appropriate 2 test .
In order to investigate the effect of confounding on observed associations , multiple logistic regression was used .
The model included all prognostic factors listed above , and the outcome variables of anxiety and depression were grouped into two categories for the multiple logistic regression analysis ( 0 - 7 vs. greater-or-equal , slanted8 ) .
The numbers of patients scoring greater-or-equal , slanted11 were small , which precluded using all three categories of anxiety and depression in a multiple regression .
The p-values from the multiple logistic regression indicate the significance of each variable after allowing for the effects of the other variables listed .
The distributions of many of the __QOL__ subscales were skewed , but no satisfactory transformation could be found to normalise the data .
Means and __SD__ , together with the median and __SD__ have been presented in order to facilitate comparison with other published data .
The univariate analyses were repeated using non-parametric tests , and similar results were obtained ( data not presented ) .
To make some allowance for chance findings due to the large number of significance tests carried out , the cut-off for statistical significance was set to a more stringent level at p=0.01 .
Results
A total of 2180 patients ( 98.7% of women accrued ) provided baseline data .
Reasons for non-compliance included change of treatment decision , withdrawal from trial and failure to complete questionnaires .
Completeness of responses on __QOL__ scales was 99% , apart from the BIS , which was 96% .
The geographic and age distributions of __START__ __QOL__ patients were comparable with the national data for breast cancer in the UK per year;24 details of ethnic groups were not available as this information was not routinely collected in the trial .
Patient and clinical characteristics at baseline are shown in Table 1. Three qu__CT__ prior to radiotherapy .
The protocol required a minimum of 2 weeks between the end of __CT__ and start of radiotherapy : the median interval ( __IQR__ ) was 35 ( 25 - 56 ) days .
Three significant interactions were observed between type of treatment and time from surgery .
First , patients not receiving chemotherapy were randomised earlier than those receiving it ( median 6.7 weeks versus 24.1 weeks , p<0.001 ) .
Second , patients undergoing __WLE__ were randomised earlier than those having mastectomy ( median 8.3 weeks versus 16.8 weeks , p<0.001 ) .
Third , mastectomy patients were more likely to receive chemotherapy than those who had wide local excision ( 62.7% versus 28.5% , p<0.001 ) .
Key QL domains : body image , sexual functioning and psychological distress
Body image ( BIS )
Over 50% women had no body image concerns ( summary scores of zero ) as shown in Fig. 1. However , scores for women undergoing mastectomy ( Mx ) ( median 7 ; ( __IQR__ 3 - 12 ) ) were significantly worse than those treated by __WLE__ ( median 3 ; ( __IQR__ 0-7 ) , p<0.001 ) .
Further , scores for women on __CT__ , ( with or without concomitant __ET__ ) , were significantly h__ST__ , ( __CT__ : median 7.0 ; ( __IQR__ 3-13 ) ; vs. no __ST__ : median 2.0 ; ( __IQR__ 0-6 ) , p<0.001 ) .
Favourable BIS scores were also seen for women who received endocrine therapy alone ( median 2.0 ; ( IQR0-5 ) ) .
The impact of __CT__ was largely explained by the effect of distress due to hair loss ; when __CT__ and the item distress over hair loss were both included in a regression model for BIS , only the effect for distress due to hair loss remained significant .
In multiple regression , type of surgery , age and __CT__ remained highly statistically significant ( all p<0.001 ) , as shown in Table 2.
p-values represent significance of F-test ( likelihood ratio test for HADS anxiety and depression ) obtained from a multiple regression model including terms for age , type of surgery , time since surgery , chemotherapy and tamoxifen .
For time since surgery and age the p-values correspond to trend tests .
p-values considered to be statistically significant ( pless-than-or-equals , slant0.01 ) are highlighted in bold .
Table shows p-values obtained from multiple regression analysis including all treatment variables and age .
Directions of statistically significant effects were as follows :
Type of surgery : scores for appetite loss and body image concerns were worse for mastectomy patients ; arm symptoms were worse for __WLE__ patients .
Time since surgery : scores for role functioning , social functioning , pain , upset by hair loss , breast symptoms and arm symptoms improved as time from surgery increased ; scores for diarrhoea , were worse with increasing time .
Chemotherapy : scores for breast symptoms were better in patients who had received chemotherapy ; scores for all other significant QL parameters were worse .
Age : scores for physical functioning , sexual functioning , sexual enjoyment were worse with increasing age ; scores for all other significant variables were better with increasing age .
__SEF__ and __SEF__ , ( BR23 )
Of 2087 patients who completed the sexual functioning questions ( 95.7% of all patients completing BR23 ) , 1164 ( 56% ) reported having no interest in sex and 54% reported being sexually inactive .
Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 3. Of 848 sexually active patients , 5% reported that sex was not enjoyable , whereas enjoyment was described as 'a little , quite a bit or very much by 34% , 39% and 22% women , respectively .
High scores on functional scales indicate high levels of functioning , whereas high scores on the symptom scales and items indicate high levels of symptoms .
low asterisk Four items from the BR23 have been combined with the 6 additional items that make up the 10 item Body Image Scale , reported separately in Table 4.
Protocol item .
857 patients ( 39.5% ) reported some degree of shoulder stiffness .
Individual items that comprise the breast symptoms summary score .
Number ( % ) of patients reporting some degree of each individual symptom are shown .
Allowing for all variables in the multiple regression , age and having chemotherapy were significant ( p<0.001 for __SEF__ and p=0.006 for __SEE__ ) .
Of note , there was no independent effect of type surgery on sexual functioning .
Anxiety and depression ( HADS )
The levels of anxiety and depression were calculated for each subscale .
The median anxiety subscale score was 5.0 ( __IQR__ 3 - 8 ) and the median depression score was 2 ( __IQR__ 1 - 5 ) .
The prevalence of anxiety was higher than for depression ; two thirds ( 1468 , 67.6% ) of patients scored in the normal range for anxiety , 391 ( 18.0% ) were in the borderline range and 313 ( 14.4% ) were probable cases , whereas 88.1% of patients ( n=1910 ) scored in the normal range for depression , 8.9% ( 192 ) were in the borderline range and 3.1% ( 67 ) were probable cases .
There was a higher percentage of cases in patients who had received __CT__ ( p<0.001 ) .
In multiple regression , low anxiety was associated with increased age but no factors had a significant effect on depression scores .
Physical domains : breast and arm symptoms ( EORTC BR23 ) , physical functioning ( EORTC QLQ-C30 )
Breast symptoms
Almost two thirds of patients reported pain in the breast area , 34.9% had swelling in the breast area , over half reported over-sensitivity and 22% had skin problems .
In the multiple regression analysis , time since surgery , age and __CT__ were significantly associated with breast symptoms as shown in Table 2. Type of surgery and __ET__ had no effect .
Arm symptoms
Significant effects were observed for type of surgery ( fewer symptoms for Mx patients , p=0.01 ) , time since surgery ( fewer symptoms with increased time since surgery , p<0.001 for trend ) , and age ( fewer symptoms in the youngest and oldest women , p=0.001 ) , ( see Table 2 ) .
Shoulder stiffness ( protocol item ) was reported as 'a little , quite a bit or very much by 30% , 7% and 2% patients , respectively , 60% being symptom free .
Standardised item scores for the full breast cancer module are shown in Table 3.
Physical functioning ( EORTC QLQ C-30 )
The distribution of __PF__ scores is presented in Fig. 2 and descriptive statistics are presented in Table 4. These showed overall high levels of __PF__ .
Only older age had a significant association with worse __PF__ in the multiple regression analysis , although the difference in median __PF__ scores across age categories was modest .
High scores on functional scales indicate high levels of functioning , whereas high scores on the symptom scales and items indicate high symptom severity .
Global health and global QL ( EORTC QLQ-C30 )
The distribution of scores for global health and global QL showed that the majority of patients recorded good or high overall __QOL__ .
Interestingly , the only significant clinical factor to affect global health and global __QOL__ was receiving chemotherapy ( see Table 2 ) .
Other __QOL__ domains and symptoms ( EORTC QLQ-C30 )
Standardised scores for the other four functional scales ( role , emotional , cognitive and social functioning ) are shown in Table 4. Also shown are mean standardised scores for the symptom scales and items .
Results of the multiple regression analyses are summarised in Table 2.
Most women had moderately good to high levels of functioning and scores were comparable with EORTC reference values .
In multiple regression , time from surgery , __CT__ and age were the main effects .
Worse cognitive functioning and better emotional functioning were associated with increased age , but the absolute difference in scores across age was small and may have been of little or no clinical significance .
For role and social functioning , improvement was observed with increased time from surgery but worse scores were associated with __CT__ .
Increased age was associated with better social functioning but worse physical functioning , whereas __CT__ rather than age was associated with increased fatigue .
Younger women reported more physical symptoms , social and financial difficulties .
Summary of impact of age and clinical variables on __QOL__ symptoms and domains
A summary of the effects of age and clinical variable is shown in Table 2 ; these effects were wide ranging involving nearly all areas of function and symptoms .
Age and __CT__ had the most extensive effects whereas __ET__ had no significant effect on key __QOL__ variables .
More __QOL__ parameters were adversely affected by younger age than older age , as detailed in the table.
Subgroup analysis and interactions
Significant interactions were observed between __CT__ and time since surgery on the scores for physical , role and social functioning , fatigue , pain and appetite loss , breast and arm symptoms , global health and global QL .
Improvements were found in fatigue , appetitive loss , global health and global QL for the NoCT group but not for the __CT__ group .
No effect of endocrine therapy on any QL domains or symptoms was found for the NoCT group .
Impact of treatment on women aged <50 years
Five hundred and eighteen ( 23.5% ) were aged under 50 years at the time of baseline assessment ( broadly considered pre-menopausal ) .
Associations between clinical variables and __QOL__ parameters were examined separately for women aged <50 years and those aged greater-or-equal , slanted50 years , and although no consistent patterns were found , the adverse effect of chemotherapy on sexual functioning appeared to be greater for the younger women ( p=0.04 ) .
However , overall , mean __SEF__ and __SEE__ scores were more favourable for women <50 ( __SEF__ : 27.2 ; __SEE__ : 62.5 ) compared to women 50 ( __SEF__ : 16.6 , __SEE__ : 57.3 ) .
Psychological morbidity prevalence rates were significantly higher for younger women ( anxiety : 41.5% of women <50 years scored 8 compared with 29.6% of women 50 years , p<0.001 ; depression : 14.9% of women <50 years scored 8 compared with 11.0% of women 50 years , p=0.02 ) .
BIS scores were also significantly higher for women <50 years ( median7 , ( __IQR__ 3 - 13 ) ) ; compared with those 50 years ( median 2 , ( __IQR__ 0 - 6 ) , p<0.001 ) , indicating more body image concern .
Discussion
Findings from this large patient population highlight the important effects of age , type of surgery and adjuvant __CT__ on the __QOL__ in women about to start radiotherapy , whilst allowing for time elapsed since first treatment .
Of particular note was the dominant effect of adjuvant chemotherapy on a wide range of __QOL__ domains : secondary analyses showed that __CT__ extenuated the otherwise beneficial effect of time from surgery on a range of __QOL__ domains , so that the majority of patients who did not receive __CT__ had better __QOL__ over time .
Interestingly , despite the deleterious effect of __CT__ on __QOL__ , there was no effect of __CT__ on psychological distress .
Patients who were younger and who had received __CT__ also had a worse future perspective , possibly consistent with their less favourable prognosis and the wide ranging impact of treatment on them .
Overall , global health / __QOL__ ratings were only affected by __CT__ , emphasising the adverse impact of this systemic therapy over and above surgery or endocrine treatment for the subgroup of women who received it .
As expected , there was a clinically significant increase in body image problems for women undergoing Mx compared with __WLE__ , as extensively reported in the literature. The effect of chemotherapy related hair loss on body image has been reported28 but a precise measure of its impact in comparison to other treatment effects has been lacking .
It is possible that weight gain due to __CT__ ( not assessed in this trial ) as well as distress due to hair loss contributed to our result .
Given improvements to body image outcomes from the use of conservative surgery , it is particularly important to identify other factors that may confound this result .
Mediating factors , ( not assessed here ) , such as the importance of appearance to an individual patient , and preference for the type of breast surgery , can also determine adjustment to body image changes and should be also be taken into account clinically .
Arm symptoms were significantly worse for women treated by __WLE__ rather than Mx , but no difference in overall physical functioning was attributable to type of surgery in the regression analysis , which is contrary to other findings.16 This may reflect the importance of controlling for other key variables when investigating these effects .
Levels of psychological distress were generally comparable with other published reports of cancer patients, and population samples,31 M. Groenvold , P.M. Fayers and M.A. Sprangers et al. , Anxiety and depression in breast cancer patients at low risk of recurrence compared with the general population : a valid comparison? , J Clin Epidemiol 52 ( 1999 ) , pp. 523 - 530 .
Article | PDF ( 200 K ) | View Record in Scopus | Cited By in Scopus ( 31 ) suggesting good psychological adaptation for the majority of women , as reported recently by Ganz et al.16 Emotional functioning was protected by older age but unaffected by clinical factors , despite the long and complex treatments involved for some women .
However , the impacts of treatment were wide ranging in other aspects of __QOL__ .
Levels of sexual activity and enjoyment were low overall , as reported in other published data. Few comparison data with age-matched healthy women are available30 but results may be similar to population samples .
There was no significant effect of Mx on __SEF__ , which was unexpected given earlier studies in this area .
However , details of sexual activity before breast surgery were unavailable in this trial , to exclude a change over time from diagnosis .
Adjuvant __CT__ had a significant impact on __SEF__ and __SEE__ , regardless of type of surgery , as reported by Ganz et al.,16 particularly the sexual well-being of younger women .
Younger women who remained pre-menopausal , through not having chemotherapy , had the best sexual functioning , suggesting the negative impact of a transition through an artificial menopause .
These results suggest that longer-term effects reported in the literature may be apparent early in the treatment pathway .
In contrast to chemotherapy , endocrine therapy had no significant effect on __QOL__ domains when other factors were controlled for , but this probably reflects the short prescribing time ; outcomes at 2 and 5 years follow-up will be more informative .
Several __QOL__ domains varied with time from surgery or age and these factors should be controlled for in other __QOL__ analyses .
The effect of age on anxiety and sexual activity may represent a moderating effect of age-related reporting , but __PF__ and other symptoms are likely to represent more direct effects .
Physical functioning was well preserved for the majority of women , with no significant worsening with chemotherapy , in contrast to other research,2 but the small age effect confirmed the findings of Fehlauer et al.35 The range of scores for other EORTC functional subscales were comparable with published reference data36 and contemporary publications.25 Frequencies of low levels of functioning were comparable to or better than reference values but the impact of co-morbidity on __QOL__ domains may be more apparent over time and will be reported separately .
This __QOL__ analysis is based on a large , representative sample of women in the United Kingdom and covers a wide age range , so that we can have confidence in the results .
Findings represent the impact of contemporary surgical methods and adjuvant systemic treatments , in contrast to many earlier studies in this field .
Care has been taken to investigate interactions to best explain the findings .
A limitation in this approach is that the trial design did not afford the chance for a pre-operative assessment of __QOL__ which may limit the interpretation of some results .
Conclusions
A broad and detailed description of __QOL__ has been presented and the independent adverse effects of age and primary treatments on __QOL__ determined , prior to undergoing radiotherapy .
Overall __QOL__ parameters were better for the majority of women who had undergone __WLE__ and avoided __CT__ .
The impact of surgery was narrow in __QOL__ terms compared with __CT__ and age effects , but all of these factors can have a clinically significant impact .
Treating teams need to be aware of the differential effects of age and primary treatments for breast cancer in women presenting for radiotherapy , in order to offer additional support and intervention for those at increased risk of poor __QOL__ .
