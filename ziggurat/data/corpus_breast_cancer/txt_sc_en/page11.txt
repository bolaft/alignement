Introduction
Endocrine therapy is the treatment of choice for the majority of patients with advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer.1 It combines efficacy with low toxicity and preservation of quality of life .
Options for endocrine therapy for post-menopausal women include tamoxifen , aromatase inhibitors and progestogens .
Until recently , tamoxifen was regarded as the gold standard for first-line therapy but the AIs have been shown to be superior.2
AIs act by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase and hence markedly reducing plasma oestradiol levels .
The first AI was aminoglutethimide that was superseded initially by second-generation AIs , such a fadrozole and formestane , owing to its toxicity of drowsiness and rash .
The third-generation AIs , all of which have the ease of once daily oral administration , have now become the treatment of choice .
Third-generation AIs are classified into type 1 inhibitors , which are steroidal analogues of androstenedione and bind irreversibly to the aromatase molecule leading to its inactivation , and type 2 inhibitors , which are non-steroidal and bind reversibly to the haem group of the aromatase molecule.2 Of the commonly used AIs , exemestane is a type 1 inhibitor and anastrozole and letrozole are type 2 inhibitors .
Previous studies have suggested a non-cross resistance , when exemastane has been used after previous treatment with other AIs but experience has been limited.3 No randomised trials have been reported as yet .
In this study , we evaluated the activity of exemestane in a group of consecutive patients who had previously received prior endocrine therapy with anastrozole or letrozole and either tamoxifen or megace .
Methods and materials
Eligibility criteria
Post-menopausal female patients who presented to a single breast cancer unit between January 2000 and June 2005 and commenced on oral exemestane 25 mg daily for locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer were identified .
The data were collected retrospectively .
Positive oestrogen and progesterone receptors were required but if receptor status was unknown , a clear response ( defined as an objective response or stable disease for more than 6 months ) to previous hormonal treatment had to be identified .
All patients have had a third-generation AI and either tamoxifen or the progestin , megestrol acetate .
Patients may also have received prior chemotherapy for neoadjuvant , adjuvant or palliative purposes .
No other concurrent anticancer treatment such as chemotherapy , endocrine therapy , immunotherapy or radiotherapy was allowed .
Bisphosphonate treatment was permitted so long as a measurable or assessable non-bony lesion was also present .
Assessment of response
Assessment of tumour response was based on the RECIST criteria.4 __CR__ was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions with no new lesions .
__PR__ was defined as at least a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions .
A 20% increase or more in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions or the appearance of one or more new lesions were considered as __PD__ .
__SD__ was defined as neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify as __PR__ nor sufficient increase to qualify for __PD__ .
Tumour responses of __CR__ or __PR__ were collectively defined as an __OR__ .
In addition , __OR__ and __SD__ for greater-or-equal , slanted6 months were classified as __OCB__ .
Patients were reviewed every 3 months until disease progression was confirmed either clinically or radiologically .
Duration of objective response was determined from the time when the criteria for __CR__ or __PR__ were met until disease recurrence or progression .
Duration of stable disease was determined from the date of commencement of exemestane until disease progression .
Any drug-related adverse effects were also noted and recorded .
Results
A total of 33 patients who commenced exemestane between January 2000 and June 2005 were identified .
Two patients were excluded as they had only bone disease and had received bisphosphonate treatment .
Therefore , 31 patients were included in the final analysis .
The median patient age was 64 yrs ( range 34 - 90 yrs ) .
The baseline demographics of these patients are shown in Table 1. Despite efforts in determining the hormone receptor status by retrospective analysis , we were unable to verify this for two patients due to insufficient histological material .
However , both had clear documented responses to prior hormonal therapy .
Thirteen patients ( 42% ) had only soft tissue disease .
Other metastatic disease sites include bone ( 45.2% ) , liver ( 25.8% ) , lung ( 12.9% ) and skin ( 9.7% ) .
A significant number of patients had been extensively pre-treated , with the average number of recurrences or progressions of disease associated with prior therapy being three .
In particular , 15 patients ( 48.4% ) had received both hormone therapy and chemotherapy previously , either as adjuvant treatment or for metastatic disease .
All patients had a third-generation AI with 90.3% having had tamoxifen and 22.6% megace as well .
At the time of analysis , 19 patients had died ( 61.3% ) while four patients ( 12.9% ) still remained on exemestane .
The mean duration of exemestane treatment was 9.2 months , with a range of 1 - 47 months .
Tumour responses are shown in Table 2. There were two CRs and four PRs , giving an objective response rate of 19.4% .
With an additional 11 patients who achieved __SD__ for more than 6 months , the overall clinical benefit rate was 54.8% .
The mean time for progressive disease , which was seen in 12 patients , was 3.2 months .
One patient had to discontinue exemestane due to vertigo attributed as a related adverse effect as her symptoms improved thereafter .
Table 3 lists the tumour response rates according to the patients baseline characteristics .
The number of patients for each factor in the __OCB__ and __PD__ columns only total up to 29 as one patient had __SD__ <24 weeks and one patient discontinued exemestane at 12 weeks .
There were no notable differences in response rates for the range of characteristics except for those who had positive receptors to both ER and __PR__ , those with only one site of disease and those with visceral disease as the predominant site of disease .
In particular , patients with predominant visceral disease seemed to have both a higher objective response rate , as well as an overall clinical benefit .
Discussion
This study demonstrates a clinically significant benefit from the steroidal AI exemestane when used after previous exposure to other endocrine therapies , including the non-steroidal AIs ( anastrozole and letrozole ) as well as tamoxifen and megestrol acetate .
The objective response rate 19.4% and the overall clinical benefit 54.8% ( including those who achieved __SD__ for greater-or-equal , slanted6 months ) suggest non-cross resistance from exemestane to the steroidal AIs .
The duration of objective response and clinical benefit of 18 and 14 months , respectively , suggest that these responses were durable .
The response rates are consistent with the report from Lonning et al. 3 in a study of 241 patients with metastatic breast cancer after failure of non-steroidal AIs , where an objective response of 6.6% and clinical benefit of 24.3% was reported .
Non-cross resistance with the non-steroidal AIs was also reported with the type 1 second-generation inhibitor formestane.5 Formestane use , however , is limited by the need for intramuscular administration .
Interestingly , for visceral metastases , the objective response rate and clinical benefit were 37% and 75% , respectively .
Visceral metastases have been traditionally regarded as less sensitive to hormonal therapies and have been treated with chemotherapy.6 Our study suggests that even when patients have failed other endocrine therapies , visceral metastases remain sensitive to exemestane .
Kvinnslant et al.7 reported an objective response rate of 25% and clinical benefit of 41% for visceral metastases treated with exemestane .
Lonning et al. reported an objective response rate of 2.3% and clinical benefit of 18% for visceral metastases in patients pre-treated with steroidal AIs in their study .
Only one patient discontinued exemestane and this is consistent with the good toxicity profile previously reported in other studies.8
There are obvious limitations to this study .
The numbers of patients treated were small .
However , these were all consecutive patients treated in a moderate-sized breast unit and accumulated over a period of 5 years .
Additionally , the data were retrospectively obtained .
As such the conclusions drawn from these data are not definitive , but they are consistent with other published data as outlined above and help to inform clinicians on a practical issue of current uncertainty , the use of further treatments in patients progressing on endocrine therapy .
For more definitive conclusions a randomised , preferably double-blind trial would be required .
One study that may add clarity in this area is the SOFEA trial in the UK , where patients who have progressed on a non-steroidal AI ( anastrozole or letrozole ) are randomised to the pure anti-oestrogen fulvestrant vs. fulvestrant plus anastrozole vs. exemestane .
Although the trial has been designed to evaluate fulvestrant , the presence of exemestane in the control arm may help to elucidate its role .
Conclusion
In this cohort of consecutive patients with advanced breast cancer treated with exemestane after they had progressed on non-steroidal AIs and tamoxifen , the objective response rate 19.4% and the overall clinical benefit 54.8% .
These responses were durable and were also seen in patients with visceral metastases .
Our study supports previous evidence of lack of cross-resistance between non-steroidal and steroidal AIs and supports the use of exemestane in this setting .
