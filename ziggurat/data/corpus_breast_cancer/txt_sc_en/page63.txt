1. Introduction
Angiogenesis is an essential component of tumour development and is tightly regulated by a network of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors .
The tumour itself is known to produce many of the proteins that drive the angiogenic process .
Of the known angiogenic factors , __VEGF__ has been established as a potent inducer of tumour angiogenesis that can activate both endothelial cell proliferation and migration 3 and 4. __VEGF__ has been shown to exert a pro-angiogenic influence in a variety of human tumours 5 , 6 , 7 and 8 , and has been shown to act as an independent prognostic indicator for breast cancer patients 9 and 10. Placenta growth factor ( PlGF ) belongs to the __VEGF__ family and was originally identified from a term placenta cDNA library as a factor related to __VEGF__ , with the ability to promote endothelial cell proliferation .
Presently , the biological role and signalling mechanisms mediating the cellular actions of PlGF remain poorly understood .
__VEGF__ is able to interact and induce signalling events through both the VEGFR-1 ( Flt-1 ) and VEGFR-2 ( Flk-1 ) receptors , whereas PlGF only possesses the ability to bind to VEGFR-1 .
However , a recent study demonstrated that activation of VEGFR-1 , by PlGF , also led to the intermolecular transphosphorylation of VEGFR-2 .
Importantly , PlGF-mediated responses via VEGFR-1 differed from VEGF-driven events , as PlGF uniquely stimulated the phosphorylation of specific VEGFR-1 tyrosine residues and expression of distinct downstream target genes .
Carmeliet and colleagues and Luttun and colleagues highlight the important role played by PlGF and VEGFR-1 in inducing the angiogenic switch in pathological conditions .
PlGF is not produced by the majority of normal human tissues .
However , PlGF can be found expressed in vascular endothelium , umbilical vein endothelial cells , trophoblasts , the eye , uterine natural killer cells and dentine matrix 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 and 21. Studies on cancer cell lines and tumour tissues so far indicate that PlGF expression was upregulated in human gastric adenocarcinoma , renal cell cancer , melanoma , cervical squamous cell carcinoma and meningiomas , whereas PlGF was found to be downregulated in thyroid carcinoma and cervical adenocarcinoma 22 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 26 , 27 , 28 and 29.
To clarify the role of PlGF in human cancer , we examined the expression of PlGF , through real-time __Q-PCR__ and immunohistochemical studies , in a cohort of human breast cancer specimens .
The degree to which PlGF was expressed in these breast tissues may correlate with clinical parameters and the prognosis of patients with breast cancer .
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Cell lines and culture
All cell lines used in this st__UK__ ) .
This study used human prostate cancer cells ( DU-145 , PC-3 , CA-HPV-10 ) , human breast cancer cells ( __MDA-MB-157__ ) , human colorectal cancer cells ( HRT-18 , HT-115 ) , human pancreatic cancer cells ( MIA PACA-2 ) , human bladder cancer cells ( EJ-138 , T-24 ) , human melanoma cells ( G-361 ) , human lung carcinoma cells ( A-549 ) , human hepatocellular carcinoma cells ( PLC-PRF-5 ) , human fibroblast cells ( MRC-5 , human fibroblasts ) , a human epithelial cell line ( ECV-304 ) and a human endothelial cell line ( HECV ) .
Cells were routinely cultured with __DMEM__ supplemented with 10% foetal calf serum , penicillin and streptomycin ( Gibco BRC , Paisley , __UK__ ) .
2.2. Human breast specimens
A total of 152 breast samples were obtained from breast cancer patients ( 33 background normal breast tissue and 119 breast cancer tissue ) .
These tissues were collected immediately after mastectomies , and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen .
Background normal mammary tissues were removed from the same patients .
The pathologist verified normal background and cancer specimens , and it was confirmed that the background samples were free from tumour deposits .
For patient clinical data see Table 1.
2.3. Preparation of total cellular RNA
Total cellular RNA was isolated from the homogenised breast samples and human cell lines using the AB Gene Total RNA Isolation Reagent ( Advanced Biotechnologies Ltd , Epsom , Surrey , __UK__ ) .
The concentration of RNA was determined through spectrophotometric measurement ( WPA UV 1101 , Biotech Photometer , Cambridge , __UK__ ) .
2.4. __RT-PCR__
cDNA was prepared using 0.5 µg of the RNA sample and a reverse transcription kit ( Sigma , Poole , Dorset , __UK__ ) .
The quality of DNA was verified using ß-actin. ß-actin forward and reverse primers were 5'-ATGATATCGCCGCGCTCGTC-3 and 5'-CGCTCGGTGAGGATCTTCA-3 , respectively , and gave products approximately 0.58 kb .
PlGF forward and reverse primers were 5'-GGAGCTGACGTTCTCTCAG -3 and 5'-ACTGAACCTGACCGTACAGTTACCTCCGGGGAACAG-3 .
PCR was performed in a GeneAmp PCR system 2400 thermocycler ( Perkin - Elmer , Norwalk CT , __USA__ ) .
Conditions for PCR were 40 s at 94 °C , 60 s at 55 °C , 60 s at 72 °C ( 30 cycles ) .
PCR products were loaded onto a 2% agarose gel and electrophoretically separated .
The gel was then visualised under ultraviolet light following ethidium bromide staining .
2.5. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
The iCycler IQ system ( BioRad , Camberley , __UK__ ) was employed 30 and 31 , to quantify the level ( shown as copies / µl from internal standard ) of PlGF in the breast specimens .
Breast cDNA samples were then examined for PlGF expression using the primers described above , along with a set of standards and negative controls .
The __Q-PCR__ technique utilised the A__Q-PCR__ master mix ( ABgene , Surrey , __UK__ ) , in conjunction with a universal probe ( UniPrimerTM ) .
Real-time __Q-PCR__ conditions were 95 °C for 12 min , followed by 65 cycles at 95 °C for 15 s , 55 °C for 60 s and 72 °C for 20 s .
The results of the test molecules were normalised against levels of ß-actin , using a ß-actin quantitation kit from Perkin - Elmers ( Perkin - Elmers , Surrey , __UK__ ) .
The epithelial content within the tumours was taken into account by normalising PlGF against cytokeratin19 .
CK19 forward and reverse primers were 5'-CAGGTCCGAGGTTACTGAC-3 and 5'-ACTGAACCTGACCGTACACACTTTCTGCCAGTGTGTCTTC-3 , respectively .
2.6. Immunohistochemical staining of breast specimens
Frozen sections of breast tumour and background tissue were cut at a thickness of 6 µm using a cryostat .
The sections were mounted on super frost plus microscope slides , air-dried and then fixed in a mixture of 50% acetone and 50% methanol .
The sections were then placed in Optimax wash buffer ( Menerium , Oxford , __UK__ ) for 5 - 10 min to rehydrate .
Sections were incubated for 20 min in a 0.6% __BSA__ blocking solution and probed with PlGF antibody , and without primary antibody as a negative control .
Antibody to the PlGF epitope mapped to the C-terminus of human PlGF , and was purchased from Santa-Cruz Biotechnologies Inc. ( Santa-Cruz , CA , __USA__ ) .
Following extensive washings , sections were incubated for 30 min in the secondary biotinylated antibody ( Multilink Swine anti-goat/mouse / rabbit immunoglobulin , Dako Inc. , Glostrup , Denmark ) .
Following washings , the Avidin Biotin Complex ( Vector Laboratories , Peterborough , __UK__ ) was then applied to the sections , followed by extensive washing steps .
Diamino-benzidine chromogen ( Vector Labs , Peterborough , __UK__ ) was then added to the sections , and incubated in the dark for 5 min .
Sections were then counter stained in Gill 's haematoxylin and dehydrated in ascending grades of methanol before clearing in xylene and mounting under a cover slip ( staining was independently assessed by the authors ) .
2.7. Wounding / migration assay
The migration of transformed human endothelial cells ( HECV ) cells across a wounded surface was examined under different treatment combinations , and has been described in a previous study .
Cells at a density of 50 000 / well were seeded into a 24 well plate and allowed to reach confluence .
The layer of cells was then scraped with a fine gauge needle to create a wound of approximately 200 µm .
Treatments consisted of recombinant human PlGF ( 30 ng / ml ) ( R&D systems , Abingdon , __UK__ ) , or a combination of recombinant PlGF and anti-VEGFR-1 ( 120 ng / ml ) ( Santa Cruz , CA , __USA__ ) .
For details of treatment concentrations and ratios see previous studies .
The movement of cells to close the wound was recorded and analysed as described previously using a time-lapsed video system .
After the addition of a treatment , the cells motile qualities were monitored and recorded on video for 100 min .
Wound closure / cell migration was evaluated with motion analysis software ( Optimus 6 ) and results were exported to a spreadsheet ( Excel ) for further evaluation and interpretation .
2.8. Growth assay
HECV were seeded in a 96 well plate at a density of 7000 cells / well , and allowed to adhere overnight .
Following this incubation period , the treatments of PlGF ( 30 ng / ml ) and a combination of PlGF and anti-VEGFR-1 ( 120 ng / ml ) were added and incubated at 37 °C for 72 h .
A solution of 3- [ 4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl ] -2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide ( MTT ) was added to the cells ( 200 µg / well ) and incubated for 4 h at 37 °C , then the cells were lysed with Triton ( 10% ) and the intensity of the colour released was determined by a plate reader ( Titertek Multiskan , Eflab , Finland ) .
The number of cells was shown as absorbance units .
2.9. Statistical analysis
The results were assessed using non-paired ( two-sided ) Student 's t-test .
PlGF transcript values obtained in the study are given as mean copy number ±SD .
A P-value <0.05 was defined as statistically significant .
3. Results
3.1. Screening of human cell lines for PlGF
A variety of 24 human normal and cancer cell lines were examined for PlGF expression through __RT-PCR__ .
PlGF was expressed in the large majority of the human cancer cell lines examined .
However , only 4 of the 9 breast cancer cell lines examined ( numbers 1 - 9 in Fig. 1 ) revealed any detectable level of PlGF transcripts .
These breast cancer cell lines displayed weak to moderate levels of PlGF .
Of the remaining human cancer cell lines , PlGF was found to be strongly expressed in the prostate ( numbers 10 - 12 ) , colorectal ( numbers 13 and 14 ) , bladder ( numbers 18 and 19 ) and melanoma ( number 21 ) .
Human fibroblasts ( numbers 15 and 16 ) revealed little or no detectable levels of PlGF .
The normal epithelial and endothelial cell lines expressed a moderate to low level of PlGF .
3.2. Expression of PlGF in paired breast specimens ( normal versus cancer )
We also performed conventional __RT-PCR__ on a panel of paired breast tissues ( n , normal ; t , tumour ) .
Both normal breast tissue and breast cancer tissue were found to express PlGF mRNA , albeit at minimal levels in normal breast specimens .
Overall , PlGF mRNA was expressed to a higher degree in the breast cancer samples when compared with normal breast tissue .
3.3. Immunohistochemical staining of human breast specimens
PlGF immunostaining was observed in the human breast tissue sections .
We reveal that the PlGF protein level was dramatically elevated in the breast tumour specimens compared with the normal breast tissue .
The patients tumour tissues displayed a more intense and widespread level of staining in the breast cancer cells compared with the very weak staining of epithelial cells in the normal breast tissue .
These results confirm our __RT-PCR__ and __Q-PCR__ data in showing that breast cancer tissues have significantly enhanced PlGF levels .
3.4. Quantification of PlGF expression in human breast tissues
We quantified the PlGF transcript expression in the breast specimens ( tumour n = 119 , background n = 33 ) using real-time __Q-PCR__ ( all __Q-PCR__ values are displayed as mean transcript copies ) .
We show that the PlGF expression value in tumours was 0.665 ± 0.35 , compared with 0.03 ± 0.017 in the normal tissue .
Therefore , our results reveal that the breast cancer tissues express significantly higher levels of PlGF ( P = 0.028 ) , compared with the low levels observed in the normal background breast tissues .
3.5. PlGF expression in relation to prognosis
We examined the PlGF level between the __NPI__ groups of breast cancer patients ( __NPI-1__ ) .
The __NPI-1__ group represented patients with a good prognosis and an __NPI__ index <3.4 , the NPI-2 group contained patients with a moderate prognosis and an __NPI__ index of 3.4 - 5.4 , whereas the NPI-3 patients had a poor prognosis with an __NPI__ index of >5.4 .
An increased degree of lymph node involvement was associated with increasing levels of PlGF .
The patients assigned to the __NPI-1__ group had a PlGF transcript value of 0.085 ± 0.028 , compared with the NPI-2 group with 0.312 ± 0.171 and NPI-3 with 3.76 ± 2.68. A Kruskal - Wallis test has shown that there is a significant association between increased levels of PlGF transcript and high __NPI__ status ( P = 0.022 ) .
Overall , patients with node involvement had raised levels of PlGF compared with those without any degree of node involvement .
However , this correlation between PlGF and prognosis did not reach statistical significance in these instances ( P = 0.13 ) .
3.6. PlGF and breast tumour grade
PlGF values in the moderate grade 2 ( 0.33 ± 0.171 , n = 41 ) and poorly differentiated and grade 3 ( 1.13 ± 0.75 , n = 55 ) tumours were elevated compared with well-differentiated grade-1 tumours ( 0.16 ± 0.02 , n = 23 ) .
This trend linking PlGF to a poor patient outlook did not reach statistical significance with the current sample number ( grade 1 versus grade 2 , P = 0.27 ; grade 1 versus grade 3 , P = 0.22 ) .
Additionally , we examined PlGF expression within the different tumour histological subtypes , although there was no apparent difference between the lobular , ductal or other tumour types .
However , Kaplan - Meier survival analysis identified PlGF as a disease-free survival factor in oestrogen receptor ( ER ) negative tumours ( P = 0.013 ) .
3.7. Tumour-node-metastasis classification of patients
PlGF expression correlated with patient outlook through __TNM__ grouping ( __TNM__ 1 , n = 68 ; __TNM__ 2 , n = 39 ; __TNM__ 3 , n = 8 ; __TNM__ 4 , n = 4 ) .
Levels of PlGF were found to be significantly elevated in tumours of patients who had an overall poor outlook ( __TNM__ 3 , 5.57 ± 5.47 ; __TNM__ 4 , 3.96 ± 3.91 ) , compared with those patients with a relatively good prognosis ( __TNM__ 1 , 0.084 ± 0.025 ; __TNM__ 2 , 0.41 ± 0.19 ) .
We reveal that PlGF was expressed to significantly higher degree ( P = 0.044 ) in patients with an overall poor outlook ( __TNM__ 3 ) compared with those with a good outlook ( __TNM__ 1 ) .
3.8. PlGF expression and survival status
We assessed the survival status of the breast cancer patients in association with PlGF levels , with an average of a 6 year follow-up period .
Patients were divided into two groups , those who remained disease-free were assigned to the good prognosis group ( n = 89 ) , whereas , the patients who had recurrence , metastasis to a distant site or had died as a result of breast cancer were allocated to the poor prognosis group ( n = 30 ) .
The quantity of PlGF from each tumour specimen was assessed and we reveal that the patients with a poor prognosis had dramatically elevated levels of PlGF ( P = 0.017 ) .
Our results show that the good prognosis group had low levels of PlGF ( 0.099 ± 0.042 ) compared with the statistically higher levels observed in the poor prognosis group ( 2.6 ± 1.51 ) .
3.9. PlGF did not significantly enhance endothelial cell migration
The cell motility assay utilised time-lapsed video monitoring to provide quantitative data on PlGF 's ability to enhance HECV cell migration .
The mean distance moved for the cells over 100 min was determined for each treatment .
The addition of PlGF slightly increased the degree of endothelial cell migration ; however , these results did not reach significance .
Therefore , no significant differences in cell motility were observed with recombinant PlGF treatment .
3.10. PlGF increased human endothelial cell proliferation
The proliferation assay examined the effect of PlGF on the proliferation rate of HECV cells .
The results showed that , over a 72 h period , there was a significant increase in the rate of proliferation in the endothelial cells cultured in PlGF compared with the control ( P = 0.036 ) .
PlGF exerts its influence through its interaction with the VEGFR-1 receptor , however , when PlGF was added in combination with an antibody to VEGFR-1 , the influence of PlGF was significantly inhibited ( P = 0.027 ) .
We confirm that PlGF plays a role in human endothelial cell proliferation , via VEGFR-1 signalling pathways .
4. Discussion
PlGF plays a putative role in tumour angiogenesis .
Studies report that PlGF stimulates formation of mature , leakage-resistant vessels in a manner comparable in efficiency to __VEGF__ 34 and 35. However , it was recently discovered that PlGF switches on its own genetic program of angiogenic genes , separate to that of __VEGF__ .
Recent studies in mice revealed that loss of PlGF impaired tumour angiogenesis , while an over-expression enhanced vascularisation and vessel permeability 35 and 36. PlGF , and its receptor VEGFR-1 ( Flt-1 ) , while being minimally expressed in quiescent vessels , are strongly upregulated in a variety of pathological conditions .
Therefore , PlGF does appear to enhance tumour angiogenesis , although there are contrasting views whether this factor influences physiological angiogenesis .
Our study is the first to quantitate PlGF expression in human breast tissue samples from breast cancer patients .
This study also assessed PlGF levels in relation to patient clinical parameters .
PlGF is not expressed in the majority of normal adult human tissues , and we confirm that PlGF was absent or at very low levels in the normal breast tissue from breast cancer patients .
Screening a panel of 24 human cells lines revealed that PlGF was expressed in a large variety of human cancer cell lines , including breast , colorectal , bladder and prostate .
This study demonstrates that PlGF was strongly expressed in the tumour tissue of the breast cancer patient specimens , and that a high degree of expression was indicative of a poor prognosis for the patient .
We confirmed that PlGF was dramatically upregulated in the patients breast cancer tissue compared with the minimal levels observed within normal breast tissues via immunohistochemical staining , and both qualitative and quantitative PCR .
Interestingly , a recent study also demonstrates that PlGF was over-expressed in nearly 90% of gastric cancers compared with non-tumour mucosa , and this expression correlated with patient clinical outcome , whereas __VEGF__ did not .
Therefore , PlGF demonstrates strong prognostic potential .
We also assessed the function PlGF in a series of in vitro assays and report that addition of recombinant PlGF enhanced endothelial cell proliferation through its interaction with VEGFR-1 ( Flt-1 ) ; however , PlGF did not significantly enhance endothelial cell migration or tubule formation in a 3-D culture system .
Lack of significant results may be due to the fact that the endothelial cells themselves produce abundant levels of PlGF in culture , which reduces their sensitivity to exogenous PlGF .
Our study demonstrates that PlGF expression correlates with breast cancer patient prognosis , as high levels of PlGF were significantly associated with a higher degree of lymph node involvement , poorly differentiated tumours and an overall poor outlook for the patient .
Therefore , we show that PlGF may exercise its role only at specific fragments of the cancer progression pathway , such as the later stages of the disease , and that PlGF may also act in tumour specific manner .
Following radio-immunotherapy , surviving tumour cells upregulate the expression of specific angiogenic factors depending on the type of tumour , and PlGF was shown to increase microvessel density but decrease the number of mature vessels 38 and 39. Therefore , it has been suggested that PlGF may play a role in the rapid restoration of a tumour blood supply after treatment , thus may enhance the possibly of recurrence .
Tumour angiogenesis is a complex process ; therefore the reported responses from PlGF / VEGR-1 signalling will make PlGF a desirable potential therapeutic target .
We conclude that PlGF is over-expressed in human breast cancer tissues and displays prognostic value in breast cancer patients .
