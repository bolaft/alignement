1. Introduction
Advanced __MBC__ is an incurable condition with a relatively long clinical course .
The development of drugs with increased activity and / or reduced toxicity is desirable in order to shift the balance further in favour of clinical benefit and improved quality of life .
__COX-2__ has been shown to be present in a varying proportion of patients with breast cancer , and is associated with poorer prognostic features.1 __COX-2__ catalyses key steps in the metabolism of arachnadonic acid to prostaglandins and eicosanoids .
__COX-2__ is inducible and not found expressed in normal tissue but only in inflammatory diseases and malignant transformation .
When in response to stimuli , cells express __COX-2__ , they develop a resistance to apoptosis and develop changes in their adhesion properties.2 __COX-2__ expression is secondary to mitogenic events such as Ras mutations and loss of p53.3 There have been responses to __COX-2__ inhibitors ( Celecoxib ) alone reported in some animal cancers,3 and 4 and they are currently being investigated as inhibitors of carcinogenesis in colorectal cancer.5 __COX-2__ also affects angiogenesis and __COX-2__ inhibitors can reduce vascular density in experimental tumours and decrease VEGF levels.6 and 7 There has only been one randomised clinical trial of NSAIDs in patients with various malignancies , which showed that patients taking indomethacin had significantly less pain and increased mean survival than controls.8
Specifically , in the cases of hormone sensitive tumours PGE2 , the final active compound of arachnadonic acid metabolism can stimulate CYP19 the aromatase gene .
Therefore , __COX-2__ derived PGE2 may also modulate cellular proliferation through stimulation of oestrogen biosynthesis within breast tumours,9 , 10 , 11 and 12 and is a potential mechanism for breast cancer induction and resistance to systemic aromatase inhibition .
__COX-2__ expression also correlates with progesterone receptor expression.13
__COX-2__ has been shown to be present in a varying but significant proportion of patients with breast cancer .
Most breast cancers that are HER2 positive express __COX-2__ immunocytochemically , and HER2 / neu stimulates __COX-2__ transcription via the Ras-MAPK pathway.14
Exemestane is a steroidal aromatase inhibitor which has been shown to be more active than megace15 and tamoxifen16 in the treatment of metastatic breast cancer .
The biological effects of __COX-2__ inhibition suggest that a combination of __COX-2__ inhibitor with an aromatase inhibitor may potentially improve the efficacy of aromatase therapy in clinical practice .
However , this combination required testing to ensure that it is tolerable and not detrimental in terms of efficacy of Exemestane alone .
This report presents the final results of a phase II trial of the combination of Exemestane and the __COX-2__ inhibitor Celecoxib .
2. Patients and methods
2.1. Patient population
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. All patients were post-menopausal with known ER positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer at first relapse .
The participants were recruited from those attending specialist breast oncology clinics at the Beatson Oncology Centre , Western Infirmary , Glasgow , Scotland .
This study was conducted in agreement with the Declaration of Helsinki ( Edinburgh , Tokyo , Venice , Hong Kong and Somerset West amendments ) .
The protocol was written , and the study conducted according to the ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline for Good Clinical Practice .
The Local Ethics Committees approved the protocol , and all patients gave written informed consent .
2.2. Study design
The principal objective of the trial was to assess the percentage of patients who neither discontinued therapy nor progressed at 6 months ( treatment successes ) .
Secondary objectives were response rates , duration of response , time to next progression , toxicity graded according to the __CTC__ 17 and __CTC__ at baseline and 3 monthly ( measured by EORTC QLQ C-30 v3.0 and QLQ-BR23 ) .
Exemestane ( Aromasin ) was given in the standard dose of 25 mg daily , and Celecoxib ( Celebrex ) was given at a dose of 400 mg bid .
There were no dose modifications allowed for Exemestane .
The dose of Celebrex could be reduced to 200 mg bid if moderate or severe toxicity occurred .
Treatment was administered until documented disease progression , unacceptable toxicity , or patient refusal .
Concomitant cytotoxic or hormonal therapies were not allowed .
Tamoxifen , if previously given , must have been discontinued prior to initiation of the study drug .
Bisphosphonates given for bony disease were not allowed , but radiotherapy for symptomatic lesions was allowed , provided that the irradiated area did not contain the sole target lesion , and provided that this was within 8 weeks of starting therapy .
The use of palliative radiotherapy after 8 weeks on study equated to disease progression .
Response evaluation conformed to the RECIST system.18 The initial assessment of the disease ( including measurement of all target lesions ) was performed within 3 weeks prior to the first treatment administration .
Follow-up assessments were performed at 8 weeks , and every 3 months thereafter until disease progression , or until the start of another treatment .
In case of detection of a complete or partial response , a confirmation assessment was performed not less than 4 weeks after the first documentation of the response .
Treatment side-effects were assessed separately for each period of therapy , at 4 weeks , 8 weeks and 3 monthly thereafter using the __CTC__ .
All eligible patients who started treatment were included in the overall toxicity analyses .
The worst grade of each toxicity thought to be at least possibly related to treatment was tabulated .
The patients who discontinued treatment because of toxicity were included in the response and toxicity analyses .
2.3. Statistical methodology
The basic hypothesis was that if the percentage of treatment successes ( patients who had not progressed and were still receiving treatment at 6 months ) was greater-or-equal , slanted50% , the treatment is clearly feasible and should be considered for future testing in a phase III setting ; alternatively if the percentage of treatment successes was less-than-or-equals , slant30% , then further testing of this combination is not warranted .
To distinguish between these two alternatives , a Simon two-stage minimax design was used with 90% power and 5% one-sided level of statistical significance ; this required a maximum of 53 patients .
For this design 24 patients are recruited in the first stage , and if 7 or fewer successes are observed , the trial is stopped with the conclusion that the successess rate is less-than-or-equals , slant30% .
If 8 or more successes are observed in the first stage a further 29 patients will be recruited .
If 22 or more success are observed over the two stages , then it is concluded that the success rate is greater-or-equal , slanted50% .
All patients were followed-up for a minimum of 12 months before the final analysis was undertaken .
All eligible patients were included in the data analysis ( except response , see below ) .
For the primary end-point , the percentage of treatment successes are reported with the associated 95% confidence interval .
The response analysis was restricted to patients with at least 1 target lesion .
Time to progression was analysed for all patients .
Duration of response , survival and progression-free survival were estimated using Kaplan - Meier techniques .
The EORTC QLQ C-30 + QLQ-BR23 module was used to assess __QOL__ .
The average value of the various scales prior to treatment failure for each patient were compared to baseline value using the Wilcoxon signed rank method .
3. Results
Between March 2002 and August 2003 , 54 patients were entered into the trial .
One patient withdrew consent before starting any treatment and has been excluded from further analysis .
Patient demographics are shown in Table 2. Thirty-six percentage of patients had visceral disease and there was an average of 1.4 disease sites per patient .
Twenty-six patients had previously received Tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment , the mean interval between stopping Tamoxifen and starting study registration was 388 ( range 0 - 2754 ) days .
Sixteen patients had received Tamoxifen for metastatic or locally advanced disease , the mean interval between stopping Tamoxifen and starting study registration for this group 94 ( range 0 - 1114 ) days .
Thirteen patients had received adjuvant chemotherapy .
Nine patients stopped treatment for reasons other than progression , 2 due to toxicity and 3 due to medical decision by their family practitioners , 1 due to renal function impairment and 3 deceased ( 1 CVA , 1 pulmonary embolism and 1 malignant disease ) .
Eight patients had a dose reduction of Celecoxib : 3 due to possible toxicity , 4 due to prescribing error and 1 due to unknown reason .
3.1. Response
The percentage of patients who had neither discontinued treatment nor progressed at 6 months , treatment successes , was 60% , 32 / 53 ( __SE__ = 6.7% , 95% confidence interval 47 - 74% ) , and at 12 months was 46% ( __SE__ 7% ) ( see Table 3 ) .
Thirty patients had target lesions and could therefore be assessed for overall response .
The response rate ( CR + PR ) was 16 / 30 ( 53% ) with a further 5 patients ( 17% ) having stable disease .
A total of 23 patients had only non-target lesions at baseline and of these 18 ( 78% ) had static disease .
By combining the best overall response of patients with target lesions and non-target lesions , the overall Clinical Benefit Rate ( CR + PR + SD ) was 39 / 53 ( 74% ) .
Six patients did not have formal reassessment of disease for response : 4 due to rapidly progressive disease or early death and 2 had therapy stopped for reasons other than progression .
All 6 were counted as treatment failures .
3.2. Duration of response and survivals
The duration of responses was calculated for the 16 patients with best overall response being CR or PR .
The median duration of response was 89 weeks ( __SE__ , 11.3 weeks ) .
__PFS__ = 6.2% ) and at 12 months was 53% ( __SE__ = 7.1% ) .
This result differs from the treatment success result due to those patients who stopped therapy without having progressed .
Overall survival is shown in Fig. 2. The median follow-up for living patients is 78 weeks ( range 35 - 121 weeks ) .
Twenty-one patients have died , 17 from malignant disease , 1 from a pulmonary embolus , 1 from a cerebral vascular accident and 1 from a surgical complication .
The cause of death for 1 patient is unknown .
The percentage of patients alive at 6 months was 87% ( __SE__ = 7% ) and at 12 months was 71% ( __SE__ = 6% ) .
3.3. Toxicity
Toxicities occurring in >10% of patients are listed in Table 4. One patient died of surgical complications 2 weeks after having repair of a perforated gastric ulcer , after being on treatment for 24 weeks , but also had progression of her metastatic breast cancer at the time .
Two patients stopped treatment due to excessive toxicity : one at 4 weeks due to oesophagitis and one at 24 weeks due to diarrhoea .
There was no significant haematological or biochemical toxicity .
One patient had grade 3 arthralgia , but only 2 further patients had arthralgia probably related to treatment , one of these grade 1 and the other grade 2.
3.4. Quality of life
The average value of the scales recorded in all the __QOL__ forms prior to treatment failure was compared to baseline using the Wilcoxon signed test .
Statistically significant differences were found in only two of the scales assessed .
The first was the constipation scale , showing less perception of constipation symptoms during treatment than at baseline ( mean change = 10 , __SE__ 3.7 , p = 0.013 ) .
The second was in the Future Perspective Scale which measures the patient 's concerns about her future health .
This showed a higher level of concern during treatment than at baseline ( mean change = 8.8 , __SE__ 3.5 , p = 0.015 ) .
4. Discussion
Despite the third generation aromatase inhibitors , including Exemestane , being a significant improvement over previously available therapies , about half of oestrogen receptor positive patients still fail to get any clinical benefit.14 and 15 There are likely to be multiple reasons for this , and it would also seem likely that there will be inter-patient variation in the mechanisms of failure with possibly more than one reason for any individual patient .
__COX-2__ inhibitors do not target a single specific growth factor pathway but , as mentioned in the introduction , there are several plausible prima facie reasons for the combination of an aromatase inhibitor with a __COX-2__ inhibitor to be of interest .
At present which of the potential interactions may be significant clinically is a matter for speculation and further biological studies in the neo-adjuvant setting are required to attempt to elucidate which of these mechanisms of interaction between __COX-2__ and aromatase inhibitors may operate .
This was a phase II feasibility study of the combination of Exemestane with Celecoxib as first line therapy for post-menopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer .
Formal responses were noted for those patients with measurable disease , but the primary end-point of efficacy was assessed by indirect measurement using the percentage of patients who had neither discontinued therapy nor progressed at 6 months ( treatment successes ) and time to next progression .
This approach was similar to , but more rigorous , the more familiar clinical benefit parameter ( CR + PR + Stable Disease at six months ) and allowed a wider , more representative , group of patients to be entered .
In particular , those with predominantly bone or bone only metastases were included .
Although generally thought to have a better prognosis in the longer term19 , in this study there was no difference in outcome for those patients with bone as the dominant or only site of metastases compared to those with measurable soft-tissue and / or visceral disease .
Nineteen percentage of patients had a performance status of 3 at entry : a group also usually excluded from clinical trials but commonly seen in routine clinical practice .
For the primary end-point , a Simon two-stage minimax design used required that 22 or more treatment successes were observed over the two stages to conclude that the success rate was greater-or-equal , slanted50% with 90% power and 5% level of statistical significance .
The success rate demonstrated here was 32 patients , comfortably exceeding the required target , and therefore the addition of Celecoxib to Exemestane is not detrimental in this population of patients .
In the sub-group of 30 patients who had target lesions as defined by RECIST criteria , the secondary end-point of response rates compared favourably with previously reported response rates for Exemestane alone with this combination demonstrating a response rate ( CR + PR ) of 53% and a clinical benefit rate ( CR + PR + SD ) of 74% .
By way of comparison , the efficacy of single agent Exemestane has been previously reported in randomised trials against other hormonal agents .
In a trial of Exemestane versus megace after tamoxifen failure , single agent Exemestane demonstrated a response rate of 15% and a clinical benefit of 37.4%,15 and as first line therapy , in a trial comparing Exemestane to tamoxifen , the response rate was 41% with a clinical benefit rate of 57%.16
The optimum effective dose of Celecoxib in this setting is unknown , and the dose of 400 mg twice daily was arbitrarily chosen as , in a randomised trial , it has been shown that whilst 400 mg twice daily caused significant regression of colonic adenomas , 100 mg bid was no better than placebo.20 No comment can be made about the efficacy or toxicity of other doses of Celecoxib other than that used in here .
The major toxicities were gastrointestinal with nausea and dyspepsia occurring in 24% of patients overall , predominantly mild but sufficient for 1 patient to stop treatment .
This is a higher rate of upper gastrointestinal toxicity than would be expected for Exemestane alone , but on the other hand arthralgia was less common than that previously reported.15 and 16 Otherwise the combination was well tolerated .
One patient , with no previous history of peptic ulceration , died of surgical complications two weeks after suffering a gastric perforation whilst on treatment .
She had been on treatment for 4 months , there was no prior gastric haemorrhage and she had widespread , progressive metastatic breast cancer , including intra-abdominal disease .
On balance it was concluded that this event was possibly , but not definitely , a direct consequence of her drug treatment .
A second patient died of a cerebro-vascular accident .
She was 79 years old , had no history of risk factors for cerebro-vascular disease and had been taking Celecoxib for 8 months .
This may have been a coincidental event but an association with Celecoxib could not be excluded .
The other non-malignant death on treatment was from pulmonary thromboembolism , a recognised complication of metastatic breast cancer , and was not clearly associated with either drug .
No patient had a cardiac adverse event .
This is the first study to report on the combination of Exemestane and Celecoxib as first line therapy for post-menopausal women with advanced or metastatic , ER positive breast cancer .
Despite the recent data on possible adverse cardiovascular effects of the __COX-2__ inhibitors , these results support the use of the combination of Exemestane with Celecoxib in phase III clinical trials for selected patients and patient groups .
Given the concerns about longer term cardiovascular toxicity , short term , 3 - 4 months , neo-adjuvant therapy trials of COX2 inhibitors with aromatase inhibitors would seem the most appropriate setting .
