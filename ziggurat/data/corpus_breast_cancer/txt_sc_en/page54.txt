1. Introduction
A great many prognostic factors in breast cancer have been described , but few when placed in multivariate analysis retain independent significance .
Prognosis is multifactorially determined and the best discrimination is achieved by integrating independently significant factors .
A widely used method of integration is the __NPI__ , for which integration of prognostic factors was devised in 19781 and the __NPI__ described in 1982.2 It is the only Index to have prospective validation , both intra- and inter-centre. Although new prognostic methods are being sought , the only published comparison of the __NPI__ with cDNA microarray analysis8 has shown no advantage in prognostic discrimination to the latter ( and measurement of the __NPI__ is much easier and at least 100 times cheaper! ) .
The __NPI__ has satisfied the criteria which should be applied to all claimed methods for prognostic prediction , namely ability
1. To separate patients into groups with significantly differing survival chances .
2. To achieve wide separation , i.e. to recognise a cured group and a group with poor survival .
3. To place a sufficient percentage of cases into each group .
4. To be applicable to all operable breast cancers , i.e. small,9 screen detected10 as well as symptomatic and those in patients of young age.11
5. To have been prospectively validated intra-centre in a new tumour set from that on which it was derived3 and inter-centre and internationally.
6. To be capable of measurement in all units and inexpensive .
Mortality from breast cancer has fallen over the last years in the Western World. Allied to that , case survival has risen .
As the __NPI__ is widely used in clinical practice,15 in the estimation of causation in legal reports and as the best present gold standard as a basis of comparison for new prognostic methods,8 there has been a good deal of demand for figures based on modern day diagnosis and case management to be provided .
Updated survival figures on the whole Nottingham-Tenovus series ( 1973 - 2000 ) and on cancers treated in 1990 - 1999 were reported in an invited paper over-viewing the __NPI__ in 2002.16
The primary objective of this paper is to report the improved figures within all __NPI__ groups in women treated for primary breast cancer in the 1990s , brought about by modern day treatment protocols .
Comparison is also made with the situation in the early to mid-1980s .
2. Patients and methods
The analyses undertaken were of consecutive women diagnosed with and treated for primary operable invasive breast cancer at Nottingham City Hospital , aged 70 years or less , with tumours of less than 5 cm diameter on clinical measurement and / or on operative histology , in 1980 - 1986 inclusive ( n = 892 ) and 1990 - 1999 inclusive ( n = 2238 ) .
Women aged over 70 were not included because of the increased confounding factor of death from other causes and because primary treatment protocols for patients of that age often differed from those for younger women , principally in the use of Tamoxifen as the sole primary therapy.17
The majority of women with tumours of greater than 5 cm diameter ( locally advanced primary tumours ) were also treated by different protocols , again by primary endocrine therapy or irradiation before any surgery18 ; these measures alter the factors used for the __NPI__ , nullifying its use after eventual surgery : therefore they have not been included in the present study .
Cases in the 1980 - 1986 set came under the care of a single surgeon ( RWB ) , with pathology by a single pathologist ( CWE ) and in the 1990s set were under the care of the integrated Breast Team at Nottingham City Hospital .
Cases referred after an initial operation for diagnosis or following treatment carried out elsewhere were excluded .
Cases diagnosed in the years 1987 - 1989 have not been included because major changes in diagnosis and treatment were made in those years : the introduction of population screening , of expertise in radiology , case management by a team of breast specialists in all disciplines , strict criteria for selection for breast conserving therapy , the introduction of selective local , regional and systemic adjuvant therapies .
Median follow-up from the 1980 to 1986 series is 21 years ( 19 - 25 ) and for the 1990 - 1999 , 8.3 years ( 5 - 15 ) .
All cases had histological assessment of node sampling , histological grade19 and tumour size .
These were the only factors recognised to have independent significance in the original multivariate analysis from which the Index was constructed and in the first intra-centre prospective verification.3
The __NPI__ is calculated as previously described : __LN__ stage ( 1 - 3 ) + Grade ( 1 - 3 ) + maximum diameter ( cm Ã— 0.2 ) , giving an observed range of __NPI__ from 2.08 ( __LN__ negative , grade 1 , 0.4 cm ) to 6.8 ( __LN__ Stage 3 , grade 3 , size 4.9 cm ) .
The earlier studies divided patients into three __NPI__ groups ; in the present report six __NPI__ groups are recognised : an __EPG__ with an observed __NPI__ range of 2.08 - 2.4 , Good ( GPG ) 2.42 to less-than-or-equals , slant3.4 ; Moderate I ( MPG I ) 3.42 to less-than-or-equals , slant4.4 , Moderate II ( MPG II ) 4.42 to less-than-or-equals , slant5.4 , Poor ( PPG ) 5.42 to less-than-or-equals , slant6.4 and very poor ( __VPG__ ) 6.5 - 6.8.
Life table survival curves have been constructed using SPSS version 13 , for both breast cancer specific and all causes of death and for both time sets .
Comparison of curves between neigbhouring __NPI__ groups and between the different time sets in each prognostic group has been made using Wilcoxon - Gehan statistics .
Analysis has also been carried out on absolute numbers of cases entered and of events .
All patients have been followed up regularly and indefinitely in the hospital __PBC__ and data on survival and recurrence recorded .
At death the hospital notes are examined and deaths allocated to With / from breast cancer or to Without known breast cancer .
Patients with diagnosed distant metastatic spread are allocated to the former , even if the disease appears to be in complete remission ; women dying without having any known distant recurrence , even if they have suffered prior local or regional recurrence of which no trace remains on or after treatment , are allocated to the latter ( unless a post-mortem study indicates otherwise ) .
Although in the early reports of the __NPI__ , survival was from all causes of death , in this paper the survival curves have provisionally been constructed for death from breast cancer although some comparisons have been made with curves for all causes of death .
3. Results
Fig. 1 shows the breast cancer specific survival for all cases diagnosed in 1980 - 1986 inclusive and of cases diagnosed in 1990 - 1999 inclusive and the overall survival for all causes of death for the two time periods .
Survival is considerably and significantly better in cases treated in the latter time period .
The relative risk reduction of death remains constant at 5 , 10 and 15 years of follow up .
Table 2 shows the percentage distribution of cases to prognostic groups in 1980 - 1986 and 1990 - 1996 and the distributions by age .
In 1990 - 1999 , 4% more lie in the better 2 __NPI__ groups ( __EPG__ and GPG ) and 1% less in the bottom two ( PPG and __VPG__ have been combined for this illustration ) .
There were no significant differences in age distribution across the prognostic groups in each time series : the mean ages diminishing in rank order from 55.5% in the __EPG__ to 51.5% in the PPG in the 1990s set .
There were no significant differences between the two sets in age distribution .
The breast cancer specific survivals ( Life Table ) for each prognostic group are shown in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 ( 1990 - 99 ) .
Survival is seen to have greatly improved in each prognostic group in the 1990 - 1999 series .
Table 3 shows the 1990 - 1999 ( breast cancer specific ) 10 years survivals and standard errors for each prognostic group and the significances of the difference between the curves of adjacent prognostic groups .
There are significant differences between all neighbouring groups , with the exception of the Excellent and Good groups , in which numbers of events are very low .
There is an excellent curvilinear inverse correlation between __NPI__ and tumour specific survival ( see Fig. 4 ) .
This function summarises a broad relativity between the __NPI__ value and 10 year survival .
An internal validation was carried out by dividing the data set into odds and evens , as entered consecutively on the database .
Fitted polynomial curves were constructed from the raw data for odds and evens in each prognostic group .
In order to revalidate the curves produced , odd values were applied to the evens series and vice-versa .
Predictions from the curves were compa__VPG__ ) .
The 10 year breast cancer specific survivals calculated by the life table method , in each __NPI__ group for the two data sets , are compared in Table 4 , together with significances of the improvement in survival , the relative risk reduction and the absolute increase in survival achieved in the 1990s within each prognostic group .
The survival increase in the 1990s is highly significant in every group , with the exception of the __EPG__ ( p = 0.025 ) , for which survival in both time periods was excellent and therefore numbers of events very small .
The magnitude of improvement within the groups is seen to lie between a relative risk reduction of 31% and 75% ( greatest in the better prognostic groups and smallest in the poorer ) .
Table 5 shows the Breast Cancer Specific Survival for each prognostic group with the expected number of extra deaths for all causes ( obtained from the Office of National Statistics for England and Wales ) subtracted .
This is compared with the observed all causes survival and the figures differ by a maximum of 2% , verifying the recording of the cause of death in this series .
4. Discussion
Overall survival is much better in the 1990s tumour set at 77% 10 years ( Breast Cancer Specific ) , compared to the patients with tumours in the 1980s tumour set at 55% , a 22% absolute increase at 10 years .
Improved case survival with time is not a new phenomenon .
Buchanan20 studied cohorts from the Mercy Hospital of Pittsburgh , showing 10 year survivals of 12% in 1895 - 1920 , rising to 58% in 1971 - 1987 .
In the UK study of Brinkley and Haybittle,21 stages I and II cases diagnosed in Addenbrooke 's Hospital , Cambridge in 1947 - 1950 had a 10 year survival of around 42% .
An analysis of operable cases treated at Nottingham City Hospital shows the overall improvement in survival in sequential 5 year cohorts of cases presenting over a 25 year span , rising from 49% in the 1970s to over 80% in the 1990s ; survival in the first of these cohorts ( 1973 - 1978 ) was at a comparable level with the last of the Buchanan cohorts ( 1971 - 1987 ) .
There were considerable changes in both the diagnosis and management of breast cancer at Nottingham City Hospital between the two sets .
Population screening for women aged 50 - 64 , as part of the UK __NHSBSP__ , was introduced in 1988 with the prevalent round completed in 1993 .
Neither local ( radiotherapy to mastectomy flaps ) , nor regional prophylaxes ( radiotherapy or surgical clearance to axillary nodes ) nor systemic adjuvant therapies , were used at all in the 1980s tumour set ; instead after surgery a watch policy was used , following the results of the UK Cancer Research Campaign Trial22 ; selection criteria for breast conserving surgery were less strict with clear margins not a requirement , resulting in a high rate of uncontrolled local recurrence.23 Case management protocols introducing criteria in the late 1990s for breast conserving surgery , axillary prophylaxis for lymph node positive cancers and selection for adjuvant systemic therapies resulted in dramatic falls in local and regional recurrences , which may have translated into improved survival .
A relatively small part of the overall improvement in case survival is from better prognostic factors at diagnosis in that there are only a few more cases lying in the better prognostic groups in the 1990s .
There is a major improvement in case survival in every prognostic group .
Improved survival within __NPI__ groups must come from improved case management .
Much of the improvement is likely to lay in the use of adjuvant systemic therapies , as anticipated from the results of the __EBCTCG__ Overview Analyses but not all the increase may be attributed to this , since women in the __EPG__ and the great majority in the GPG were not selected for adjuvant therapies and yet improved survival was observed within these groups .
This paper presents the survival according to the __NPI__ group in which the patient lies , to be expected from present-day case management protocols .
This report is of importance and is overdue and much demanded , because the __NPI__ is frequently used in decisions on adjuvant therapy in individual cases.15 __NPI__ is also used as the basis for calculating loss of life expectancy in medico-legal cases .
For both uses the breast cancer specific survival is the basis of the calculation ; in addition it is known that natural life expectancy has greatly increased in recent decades and consideration of breast cancer specific survival thereby becomes more relevant .
The __NPI__ is also used to provide a basis for the assessment of newly designed methods for prognostication in breast cancer , such as by microarray techniques.8 The stratification provided by the __NPI__ has allowed audit of the performance of units in screening10 and has been used to select cases for clinical trials , e.g. the British Association of Surgical Oncology BASO II trial of breast conserving surgery in excellent prognosis cases .
