Introduction
Kylie Minogue 's diagnosis of breast cancer was announced in the British media on 17th May 2005 .
The story was given considerable attention in all major British newspapers and news programmes ; the London-based tabloid The Sun ran the story on its first seven pages .
The media attention is already known to have increased elective bookings for mammograms in Australia.1 This report examines the effect of Kylie 's breast cancer announcement on __GP__ referrals and subsequent diagnoses at a __GP__ in the United Kingdom .
Materials and methods
The Royal Gwent Hospital , Newport serves a population of around 500,000 .
All referrals by __GP__ 's to the __RABC__ are considered .
During the time period considered , from January 2000 to September 2005 a total of 13,813 referrals were received .
The date of referral is that on which the __GP__ letter was received by the hospital .
Patients referred from the UK mammogram screening service are not considered as these appointments are made automatically , not by choice .
Investigations and subsequent diagnoses are considered by the month of referral , but were not necessarily performed during that month .
Time series analysis with __ARIMA__ was used to project data for June 2005.2 Data was calculated using monthly data from the preceding 5 years .
All P values are two sided and used a significance threshold of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences version 14.0 ( SPSS Inc , Chicago , IL , USA ) , and MicrosoftÂ® Excel 2002 ( Microsoft Corporation , USA ) .
Results
The number of referrals by month to the __RABC__ is shown in Fig. 1. There was an obvious peak of 322 referrals in June 2005 , the month following Kylie 's diagnosis .
This represents a 61% increase compared to the projected value for June 2005 of 200.1 ( 95% CI 154.8 - 245.4 ; P<0.001 ) from time series analysis , and a 66% increase in monthly referrals for June 2005 compared to a monthly mean for the preceding months of 2005 of 195.4 ( 95% CI 178.4 - 212.4 , P<0.001 ) .
Analysis for November 2004 ( 263 referrals ) following breast cancer awareness month in October 2004 , shows a non-significant 27% increase compared to the projected value of 207.5 ( 95% CI 163.8 - 251.2 ; P=0.102 ) from time series analysis .
When repeated for other months of 2005 up to September , there is no significant deviation from the time series model or means .
The age distribution of referrals in June 2005 was similar to the other months of 2005 and 2004 , although there were a slightly larger proportion of referrals in the 31 - 40 age group in June 2005 compared to June 2004 and the monthly mean for the other months of 2004 and 2005 .
There were no significant differences in the proportions of referrals for the major presenting symptom groups ; pain , lump and nipple discharge , in June 2005 compared to time series analysis data .
The number of investigations performed on patients referred in June 2005 shows a significant increase in mammograms ( 178 vs. 105.5 ( 95% CI 70.1 - 140.9 ) , P=0.020 ) and ultrasound scans ( 191 vs. 112.2 ( 95% CI 83.6 - 140.8 ) , P=0.003 ) performed in June 2005 when compared to the time series analysis .
There was no increase in core biopsies or fine needle aspiration cytology tests performed .
There were no more malignant diagnoses made in June 2005 than projected ( 16 compared to 22.3 ( 95% CI 12.7 - 31.9 ) , P=0.246 ) .
This trend continues into subsequent months with 20 , 17 and 15 malignant diagnoses in July , August and September , respectively .
Discussion
The effect of celebrity illness on health behaviour is well recognized .
Public awareness and acceptance of breast cancer was created primarily by Betty Ford and Nancy Regan talking openly about the disease in the 1980s.3 Following Nancy Regan 's mastectomy for a cancer amenable to breast-conserving surgery , the number of mastectomy 's performed in the United States increased.3
The media attention towards Kylie 's breast cancer increased mammography bookings by 40% during the two weeks of publicity in Australia.1 It also appears to have increased our number of referrals for the following month from that projected by 61% .
This is more than double the increase observed in our __RABC__ in November 2004 following breast cancer awareness day in October 2004 .
The increase in June does not appear to constitute referrals which would have been made in subsequent months regardless , as the referral lull usually seen in August is not present in 2005 .
The media played on the susceptibility of young women to breast cancer ( Kylie was 36 years old at diagnosis ) , which is likely to explain the increased proportion of young women presenting .
Media attention towards Kylie 's cancer appears to have affected public perception of breast symptoms , increasing referrals to our service .
The increase in referrals may represent women with longstanding disease who have become more breast aware, or those previously reassured who have become increasingly concerned due to the media coverage .
Results are encouraging in that the increase in referrals has yielded no more malignant diagnoses ; this may reflect the pre-existing standard of breast awareness in the community , __RABC__ or breast cancer screening success .
This should be reassuring to women alarmed by the media coverage , especially young women in whom the risk of breast cancer is low .
However , the number of radiographic investigations performed in June 2005 increased significantly with no increase in cancers detected .
The risks of mammographic radiation , particularly in younger age groups is generally accepted.4 Mammography with subsequent invasive investigation has been shown to significantly increase anxiety , again especially in younger age groups.5 Such media attention may then be detrimental in terms of an increase in investigative exposure and negative psychological impact for little overall benefit .
Conclusions
The announcement of Kylie Minogue 's breast cancer significantly increased referrals to our __RABC__ during the following month .
This was not accompanied by a significant rise in malignant diagnoses .
It is encouraging that media campaigns appear to make women more breast aware: however there may also be a detrimental effect by means of increased radiation exposure , anxiety and cancer phobia .
