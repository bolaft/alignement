Treatment strategies for early breast cancer
The __AIs__ , anastrozole , letrozole and exemestane , have demonstrated efficacy and tolerability in a variety of clinical settings , and have recently replaced tamoxifen as the standard treatment for postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.1 There is ongoing debate as to whether the best strategy for AI administration would be 5 years of adjuvant treatment directly following surgery , or whether they should be given following 2 years of prior tamoxifen .
Trials of different design have been devised to test a variety of treatment strategies that reflect different clinical scenarios ; however , neither the optimal timing nor the duration of AI therapy has been established yet.2
In initial adjuvant trials , newly diagnosed patients who are suitable for adjuvant endocrine therapy are randomised to receive 5 years of treatment with either tamoxifen or an AI .
In switching trials , patients who have received 2 - 3 years of adjuvant therapy with tamoxifen as part of a 5 year course are enrolled to compare the relative efficacy of continuing with tamoxifen or switching to an AI .
Patients still receive a total of 5 years of treatment .
Extended adjuvant trials evaluate the benefit of additional endocrine therapy by randomising patients who have received a standard 5 year course of tamoxifen to receive further treatment with an AI or placebo .
In sequencing trials , newly diagnosed patients who are about to begin adjuvant therapy are randomised to either tamoxifen followed by an AI , versus one or more of the following : tamoxifen for 5 years , an AI for 5 years or the reverse sequence of an AI followed by tamoxifen .
This paper reviews the clinical evidence to date for the efficacy of the __AIs__ as adjuvant therapy , examining each of the treatment strategies and highlighting the differences between these approaches , and their implications .
Comparative trials of the __AIs__ as initial adjuvant therapy
The efficacy and tolerability of anastrozole versus tamoxifen as initial adjuvant therapy were assessed in a large , randomised , multicentre trial , the __ATAC__ trial.3 The Breast International Gr__ATAC__ and time to recurrence , compared with tamoxifen.3 Similarly , in the BIG 1-98 trial , letrozole was also shown to be superior to tamoxifen in terms of __DFS__ and time to recurrence.4 To date , there are no available data for exemestane as initial therapy , although the __ATAC__ study is currently ongoing.5
Switching and sequencing trials of __AIs__
In switching trials , patients who had tolerated 2 - 3 years of initial tamoxifen treatment without recurrence are randomised to either continue tamoxifen or to switch to an AI , with the total length of treatment being 5 years in each case .
This strategy directly evaluates the best treatment for women who are already receiving tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy , but is sometimes used naively to make statements about newly diagnosed patients , which can be misleading .
Switching trials__ITA__ trial and the __ITA__ .
In the ABCSG 8 , ARNO 95 and __ITA__ trials , postmenopausal women with hormone-sensitive , early stage breast cancer who had received 2 - 3 years of tamoxifen were randomised to continue with tamoxifen , or to switch to anastrozole to complete 5 years of endocrine treatment.6 Data from these three large trials were combined in a meta-analysis , which showed that switching to anastrozole provides significant improvements in __DFS__ , event-free survival , distant recurrence-free survival and overall survival compared with remaining on tamoxifen .
There was statistically no significant difference in death after recurrence ( breast-cancer death ) , between the two treatment groups.9 In the __IES__ trial , postmenopausal women who were disease-free after 2 - 3 years of tamoxifen were randomised to switch to exemestane or to continue with tamoxifen for a total of 5 years.8 At a median follow-up of 55.7 months , patients who switched to exemestane showed improved __DFS__ .
In addition , a survival advantage for the exemestane group was demonstrated when known oestrogen receptor-negative patients were excluded from the analysis.8
Data from these trials show a definite advantage for switching patients who are already receiving tamoxifen to one of the __AIs__ .
However , because patients who recurred early or experienced adverse events during the initial tamoxifen treatment period were excluded from these trials , the analysis population is enriched with patients who respond well to endocrine treatment .
Therefore , caution must be used when trying to place these results in the context of results from the upfront adjuvant trials .
In initial and sequencing trials , newly diagnosed patients are randomised to receive either tamoxifen or an AI alone for 5 years , and a sequence of tamoxifen followed by an AI , or an AI followed by tamoxifen .
This approach compares standard tamoxifen therapy with an AI or a sequence involving tamoxifen and an AI .
The BIG 1-98 study compared initial adjuvant therapy with letrozole or tamoxifen , but also included two ongoing sequencing therapy arms , where patients were randomised to 2 years of tamoxifen followed by 3 years of letrozole , or 2 years of letrozole followed by 3 years of tamoxifen.4 Another initial / sequencing trial is the __TEAM__ study , where 7000 patients have been randomised to receive either exemestane or tamoxifen for 5 years.5 However , when data from the __IES__ trial showed that switching to exemestane conveyed significant benefits in DFS,8 the __TEAM__ trial was modified so that patients in the tamoxifen arm would be switched to exemestane , thus comparing 5 years of exemestane with a sequence of tamoxifen and exemestane.5 As both the BIG 1-98 and the __TEAM__ studies are currently ongoing , there are no available data at present from trials comparing sequenced therapy ( tamoxifen to an AI ) versus initial therapy with an AI .
Results from such trials are eagerly awaited.
It must be remembered that the patient populations in switching trials are different from sequencing or upfront trials and results cannot be compared directly , but only via a mathematical model .
__AIs__ as extended adjuvant therapy
In extended AI adjuvant-therapy trials , patients who had been treated with a 5 year course of tamoxifen are randomised to receive further treatment with an AI or no further active treatment ( ie a placebo ) .
Similar trials looking at adding another 5 years of tamoxifen have also been undertaken ( NSABP B14 , Scottish , ECOG 4181 , ATTOM.ATLAS ) .
They are currently being analysed by the Oxford overview group and are not considered here .
As with switching trials , patients with recurrences or adverse events during the adjuvant-therapy period are excluded from the patient population .
The National Cancer Institute of Canada trial , MA-17 , examined the efficacy of letrozole as extended adjuvant therapy after a 5 year course of tamoxifen .
Postmenopausal women completing 5 years of tamoxifen were randomised to receive letrozole or a placebo for 5 years .
At a median follow-up of 30 months , women treated with letrozole had significantly better __DFS__ and distant __DFS__ than those treated with a placebo .
Overall survival was significantly better with letrozole only in lymph-node-positive patients.10 In the ABCSG 6a trial , 856 hormone receptor-positive postmenopausal women who were recurrence-free after 5 years of adjuvant tamoxifen were randomised to either 3 years of anastrozole or no further treatment.11 At a median follow-up of 62.3 months , the risk of recurrence ( local , contralateral or distant ) was significantly reduced in patients treated with anastrozole , compared with those receiving no further treatment.11
In the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project trial , B-33 , recurrence-free patients completing 5 years of tamoxifen were randomised to receive exemestane or placebo for a further 5 years.12 When results from trial MA-17 showed that extended adjuvant therapy with letrozole after 5 years of tamoxifen provided significant benefits , the B-33 trial was closed prematurely , so that exemestane therapy could be offered to the patients receiving the placebo .
After a median follow-up of 30 months , preliminary results indicate a highly significant improvement in relapse-free survival in favour of exemestane , a near-significant improvement in __DFS__ , but no early difference in overall survival.13 In summary , the extended adjuvant-therapy trials of the __AIs__ suggest that there are benefits to be gained by prolonging the 5 year tamoxifen therapy period with AI treatment , compared with giving no further treatment .
However , the optimal duration of extended therapy remains undetermined , and there are currently no trials comparing different durations of upfront AI therapy .
Interpreting clinical trial data for the __AIs__
Due to the lack of trials evaluating the effectiveness of one AI against another , as well as of trials directly comparing different treatment strategies , the only way that data can be compared at present is indirectly across trials .
However , there are inherent problems when making such comparisons , the most frequent confounding factor being methodological differences between the trials .
For example , the definition of __DFS__ ( the primary endpoint ) in the BIG 1-98 trial was defined as the time from randomisation to the earliest invasive recurrence at any site , including secondary ( non-breast ) malignancies or death from any cause .
In the __ATAC__ trial , the definition of __DFS__ did not include new secondary tumours and , therefore , it would not be meaningful to compare the __HRs__ for __DFS__ across these trials .
The most comparable measure between both trials appears to be time to recurrence , and according to this endpoint , both __AIs__ achieved similar __HRs__ compared with tamoxifen .
This is also the most sensitive efficacy endpoint and should replace __DFS__ as the primary endpoint in adjuvant treatment of early breast cancer .
It is also important to ensure that the patient populations compared are similar , for example , as all patients in the BIG 1-98 trial were hormone receptor-positive , the equivalent group of patients in the __ATAC__ trial should be used for any comparisons .
Subgroups
Subgroup analyses of clinical-trial data are often carried out to investigate treatment effects on certain patient populations ; however , these analyses can be potentially misleading and need to be viewed with caution as they are the source of most errors in interpreting clinical-trial data .
For example , unless there is strong a priori evidence for restricting an analysis to a specific subgroup , it is inappropriate to evaluate the effects of treatment on a single subgroup by examining the 95% __CI__ for that subgroup .
Doing so can lead to two types of error : ( i ) attributing an effect to a subgroup when there is no overall effect , and ( ii ) claiming a lack of effect in a subgroup when the overall effect is significant .
Furthermore , the more subgroups into which a data set is divided , the more likely it is that a statistically significant difference will be found between them by chance , even when the subgroups are chosen at random .
This is an error of the first type given above and is due to the problem of multiple comparisons , which invalidate conventional P-values unless a Bonferroni-type correction is made .
The second kind of error mentioned above ( lack of effect in a subgroup when the overall effect is significant ) can be demonstrated by two examples of subgroup analyses that concluded tamoxifen was only effective in postmenopausal women , and anastrozole was no better than tamoxifen in patients receiving prior adjuvant chemotherapy , both of which are now known to be false .
Hence , subgroup analyses should concentrate on differences from the average overall treatment effect , i.e. on whether the subgroup 95% __CI__ contains the overall effect or not.17 One advantage of this approach is the ability to demonstrate consistency of treatment effect across different subpopulations .
Recent subgroup analyses of time to recurrence and disease progression from the __ATAC__ and BIG 1-98 data have indicated that both anastrozole and letrozole are superior to tamoxifen , regardless of nodal status , tumour size or prior chemotherapy .
Modelling recurrence data from clinical trials
Indirect comparisons between switching trials and upfront trials cannot be made using __HRs__ directly , but one can use a model to account for the whole adjuvant treatment period for both groups .
Ideally , direct comparisons would be done between upfront versus sequencing strategies , but no data are currently available .
However , information on which strategy is best for patients is needed .
In the absence of any direct comparative data , mathematical models have been developed that do allow comparisons of data from all trial types ( initial adjuvant therapy , switching , sequencing , and extended adjuvant regimens ) to determine the most effective treatment strategy for newly diagnosed patients , i.e. whether it is better to start therapy with an AI or use it sequentially after 2 years of tamoxifen .
To address this question , a 'surface model was developed , which used the available data to predict treatment outcomes.18
The main endpoint analysed in the model was recurrence ( including local and distant recurrence and contralateral tumours ) , as this endpoint best measures any effects specifically related to breast cancer.18 The use of recurrence rates at a fixed time gives equal weight to early and late recurrences , although it is clear that an early recurrence is more detrimental than a later one .
To compensate for this , the time-to-recurrence curves were integrated to give the percent of time lost to recurrence , for example , a recurrence at year 1 would lose 90% of the first 10 years to recurrence , but a recurrence at year 9 would only lose 10% .
A carryover treatment effect of 2 or 5 years was assumed ( based on data from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group and __ATAC__ ) .
This model confirms that 5 years of initial adjuvant therapy with an AI is superior to 5 years of tamoxifen , and suggests that initial therapy is better than a sequencing strategy of tamoxifen followed by an AI , as recurrence rates and time lost to recurrence were lower with initial AI therapy , compared with tamoxifen alone or a sequencing strategy .18
Recently , this model has been updated with newly available data , i.e. a HR for recurrence of 0.76 with an AI as initial adjuvant therapy ( based on data from __ATAC__ and BIG 1-98 ) ; a HR of 0.70 for switching / sequencing strategies ( based on data from ARNO 95 , ABCSG 8 , __ITA__ and __IES__ ) ; and a HR of 0.56 for extended adjuvant trials ( based on data from MA-17 , ABCSG 6a and B-33 ) .19 Assuming a 5 year carryover period , the model examined the effect of 5 or 10 years of treatment with either tamoxifen , an AI or a switch at different times and a 10 or 20-year follow-up .
The predicted recurrence rate at 10 years was 17.7% for initial AI treatment , compared with 22.9% for 5 years of tamoxifen ; the average time lost to recurrence would be reduced by 2.8% ( 3.4 months ) .
The model also indicated that starting with an AI is slightly more effective than 2 years of tamoxifen followed by an AI , and that longer treatment ( for example , 10 years ) may be beneficial.19 Very recent data from ATAC20 after 100 months median follow up have confirmed the predictions of the model out to 9 years and show an additional benefit of anastrozole over tamoxifen in the posttreatment period ( HR=0.75 ; P=0.01 for this period ) in addition to that already demonstrated during active treatment .
A different model comparing 10 year __DFS__ rates after 5 years of tamoxifen , an AI alone , or switching to an AI after 2.5 or 5 years of tamoxifen , has also been described.21 This model suggested that switching to an AI after 2.5 years of tamoxifen provided better __DFS__ rates than tamoxifen or an AI alone , or than switching strategies .
However , this particular model used a mixture of endpoints ( __DFS__ and time to recurrence ) from different trials , which are not interchangeable , and the definition of __DFS__ varied between the trials.21
These models are limited by the lack of direct comparisons of initial treatment with an AI versus a sequencing strategy .
Trials directly comparing these two treatment strategies would be desirable , as well as trials addressing the optimal duration of treatment with an AI .
Molecular markers for deciding whether to use tamoxifen or an AI
Early suggestions that progesterone-receptor negativity might be able to predict which women with oestrogen receptor-positive tumours will benefit most from an AI22 have not been confirmed in later studies.23 Other studies have suggested that the effectiveness of tamoxifen is affected by polymorphisms in the CYP 2D6 gene. This has led to suggestions that the benefits of AI over tamoxifen might be restricted to subgroups of women who are poor metabolisers of tamoxifen .
The impact of cytochrome P450 genotypes on the efficacy of tamoxifen versus __AIs__ in postmenopausal women with early breast cancer has recently been investigated.26 This model is based on the assumption that the metabolism of tamoxifen is critical to its efficacy , with endoxifen being the most important metabolite .
Furthermore , the model undervalues the relative contribution of another equipotent metabolite ( 4-hydoxy-tamoxifen ) 27 to the efficacy of tamoxifen , presumably on the basis of its lower plasma concentration .
A key assumption was that heterozygotes for the CYP2D6*4 / *4 mutation , as well as homozygotes , have depleted levels of endoxifen .
The authors assumed a fixed population incidence for CYP 2D6 genotypes and used the results of the BIG 1-98 trial to test their model .
They concluded that the benefit of AI over tamoxifen may be explained by the percentage of patients ( 28% ) who were either homozygotes ( not , vert , similar4% ) or heterozygotes ( not , vert , similar24% ) for CYP2D6*4 , and who gained little or no benefit from tamoxifen therapy .
For the rest of the ( wild-type ) patients with adequate endoxifen levels , they suggest tamoxifen may be as efficacious as , or even superior to , treatment with an AI .
This conclusion is strongly based on the assumption that heterozygotes have little benefit from tamoxifen , and this is difficult to reconcile with the lack of dose response for the effectiveness of tamoxifen .
In addition , several studies have not confirmed any difference in efficacy ( in terms of __DFS__ ) between CYP 2D6 heterozygotes and the wild-type genotype, and suggested other CYP polymorphisms may be as important as CYP 2D6 for predicting tamoxifen efficacy. While it is clearly desirable to tailor AI treatment versus treatment with a selective oestrogen-receptor modulator , according to which treatment will benefit the patient most , this field is still in its infancy and no results are sufficiently well established at this stage to be used in clinical practice .
Conclusions
The evidence to date from initial adjuvant trials indicates that upfront treatment with an AI is preferable to using tamoxifen for 5 years in postmenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive , early breast cancer .
Switching trials do not take into account the poorer outcome associated with tamoxifen in the years before the switch and they cannot be used directly to make conclusions about a prospective sequencing strategy without adjusting for this initial deficit .
However , results from switching trials of the __AIs__ do indicate that if patients are already receiving tamoxifen , then switching to an AI may be beneficial .
Extended adjuvant trials have also shown that prolonging endocrine therapy with an AI may be helpful , although the optimum duration of extended treatment has yet to be established and may depend on the prognostic factors of the cancer ( for example , stage and grade ) .
Results from ongoing sequencing trials ( BIG 1-98 and __TEAM__ ) will ultimately establish whether starting treatment with an AI is more effective than 2 years of tamoxifen followed by an AI .
Until then , mathematical models have been developed as a way of synthesising data from different strategies to allow comparisons .
Our model has suggested that initial treatment with an AI for 5 years is always superior to tamoxifen and that 5 years of an AI is superior to 3 years of an AI after 2 years of tamoxifen.18 In addition , the success of extended adjuvant trials suggests that a longer endocrine treatment period may be beneficial and this is a key question for the next generation of trials .
