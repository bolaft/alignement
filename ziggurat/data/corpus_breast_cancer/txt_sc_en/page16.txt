Introduction
Treatments for __ABC__ are essentially palliative , therefore as well as proven efficacy the desired goal of treatment is a long duration of response and maintenance of quality of life .
Endocrine therapies are generally the treatment of choice in patients with __HR__ -positive __ABC__ , as they are as effective as cytotoxic chemotherapy , but are better tolerated .
Tamoxifen is a __SERM__ that has been the mainstay of endocrine treatment for more than 30 years .
Although tamoxifen is an oestrogen receptor ( ER ) antagonist in breast tissue , it acts as an ER agonist in bone , endometrium and other tissues , thus offering a bone-protective effect,1 but increasing the risk of endometrial cancer and thromboembolic events.2 and 3 Other SERMs , such as droloxifene , idoxifene , toremifene and raloxifene , can also act as ER agonists , and clinical trials have shown they are not superior to tamoxifen in the first-line setting4 and 5 and have poor efficacy following tamoxifen failure.3
__AIs__ reduce systemic and tumour oestrogen concentrations in postmenopausal women by blocking the conversion of androgens to oestrogens .
__AIs__ can be divided into two main classes , non-steroidal __AIs__ ( anastrozole , letrozole and aminoglutethimide ) and steroidal __AIs__ ( exemestane and formestane ) .
The non-steroidal __AIs__ can be further subdivided into the triazole derivatives ( anastrozole and letrozole ) and the aminoglutethimide-like compounds .
All steroidal compounds are derivatives of androstenedione , the main substrate of aromatase.6
Third-generation __AIs__ ( anastrozole , letrozole and exemestane ) , are now replacing tamoxifen in the first-line advanced and adjuvant settings as they have superior efficacy and in some cases , tolerability advantages.7 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 and 13
All tumours eventually develop acquired resistance to endocrine agents and disease progression then occurs .
High-dose oestrogens , such as diethylstilboestrol or ethinyl oestradiol , or progestins ( such as megestrol acetate ) , may be effective following failure on tamoxifen and / or __AIs__ , but their use is limited by their toxicity profiles .
Although these agents may be a more convenient option than chemotherapy for patients who have progressed on conventional treatments , yet remain potentially responsive to hormonal manipulation .
With the increasing use of __AIs__ early in the treatment sequence , there is a need for new non-cross-resistant agents that are effective and well tolerated following tamoxifen and / or AI failure .
Once integrated , these agents offer the potential to extend the endocrine treatment sequence , which may delay the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and maintain good quality of life for the patient .
Fulvestrant
Fulvestrant is a new type of ER antagonist that , in contrast to tamoxifen and other SERMs , has no agonist effects .14 and 15 Fulvestrant has a novel mode of action ; it binds , blocks and degrades the ER and consequently lacks cross-resistance with other endocrine agents.14 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 and 20
Fulvestrant competes with oestradiol for binding to the ER and has a binding affinity >35 times stronger than that of tamoxifen and 89% that of oestradiol.14 Its steroidal structure prevents ER dimerisation and blocks nuclear localisation of the receptor.16 Any fulvestrant-ER complexes that do enter the nucleus are transcriptionally inactive , because both activating functions of the ER ( AF1 and AF2 ) are disabled , which is in contrast to tamoxifen and other SERMS that only inactivate AF2 and therefore possess partial agonist activity .
The fulvestrant - ER complex is unstable , resulting in accelerated degradation of the ER protein compared with oestradiol- or tamoxifen-bound receptors.18 and 19 This results in a downregulation of the ER and a subsequent inhibition of oestrogen signalling , resulting in reduced levels of progesterone receptor21 and inhibition of the expression of genes associated with tumour progression , invasion , metastasis and angiogenesis.22
Tamoxifen-resistant disease
Efficacy of SERMs
The objective response rates in a Phase II crossover study involving 66 postmenopausal women with advanced HR-positive breast cancer who received toremifene 240 mg / day or tamoxifen 40 mg / day as first-line treatment were 29% and 42% , respectively.23 Following disease progression on first-line toremifene or tamoxifen , 44 patients were switched to the comparator agent , but no responses were observed , indicating that toremifene and tamoxifen are cross-resistant in patients with ABC.23 Clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of other SERMs , such as droloxifene , idoxifene and raloxifene , have shown that these agents also have minimal activity in tamoxifen-resistant disease.3
Efficacy of __AIs__
Third-generation __AIs__ , such as anastrozole , letrozole and exemestane , are effective following tamoxifen failure.11 , 24 , 25 and 26 In randomised , double-blind trials , the clinical benefit rates ( complete response , partial response or stable disease for greater-or-equal , slanted24 weeks ) range from 27% to 37% with these AIs.11 , 24 and 25 Retrospective questionnaire data from the combined analysis of two large , international , randomised studies ( __TARGET__ trials ) , have demonstrated a clinical benefit rate of 57% for anastrozole following tamoxifen failure .
An objective response was observed in seven ( 7% ) of these patients.27 A double-blind crossover study ( the Swiss Group for Clinical Cancer Research [ SAKK ] 21 / 95 sub-trial ) , including patients from the Swiss centres of the __TARGET__ trial , further investigated the clinical benefit of anastrozole in this sequence.28 Of the 18 patients who received anastrozole following progression on tamoxifen , eight gained clinical benefit ( 44% ) ,28 which is a similar rate to that seen after crossover in the __TARGET__ trial overall.27
However , in line with current treatment guidelines , the __AIs__ are increasingly being used earlier in the sequence in preference to tamoxifen.10 and 29 Therefore , there is a need for new treatments that are effective in tamoxifen-resistant disease in order to fill this gap .
Efficacy of fulvestrant
Fulvestrant entered clinical trials after preclinical studies suggested it was active in tamoxifen-resistant cancer.30 and 31 An initial Phase II study analysing the pharmacokinetic , pharmacological and anti-tumour effects of fulvestrant demonstrated that it was not cross-resistant with tamoxifen in the clinical setting and was well tolerated.32 Subsequent Phase III trials ( 0020 and 0021 ) 33 and 34 compared fulvestrant with anastrozole in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast carcinoma who had progressed after prior antioestrogen therapy .
The intent-to-treat population for the combined analysis of these trials included 851 patients ; 428 patients received fulvestrant 250 mg monthly and 423 patients received anastrozole 1 mg daily.35
At a median follow-up of 15.1 months , fulvestrant was at least as effective as anastrozole in terms of time to progression ( 5.5 months vs. 4.1 months , respectively [ hazard ratio 0.95 ; 95.14% confidence limits 0.82 - 1.10 ; P=0.48 ] ) and objective response ( 19% vs. 17% , respectively ; treatment difference 2.75% [ 95.14% confidence limits 2.27 - 9.05% ; P=0.31 ] ) .35 At an extended median follow-up of 22.1 months , the median duration of response was 16.7 months in patients receiving fulvestrant and 13.7 months in patients receiving anastrozole.35 A survival analysis ( median follow-up 27.2 months ) showed no significant difference in the median time to death between fulvestrant and anastrozole ( 27.4 months vs. 27.7 months , respectively [ hazard ratio 0.98 ; 95% confidence limits 0.84 - 1.15 ; P=0.81 ] ) .36
Retrospective analyses of the combined data demonstrated that in the subgroup of patients ( n=381 ) with visceral metastases , the objective response , clinical benefit rates and duration of response were similar to that in the overall population.37 This is of interest as patients with visceral metastases are often thought to respond poorly to endocrine therapy .
Moreover , a retrospective questionnaire-based follow-up analysis showed that progression on or after treatment with fulvestrant does not appear to preclude response to subsequent endocrine treatments , including anastrozole , letrozole , tamoxifen and megestrol acetate.38
Fulvestrant is therefore unique among ER antagonists as it is as effective as __AIs__ in tamoxifen-resistant disease .
AI-resistant disease
Third-generation __AIs__ profoundly reduce plasma and breast tumour oestrogen levels .
__LTED__ is a situation analogous to that caused by long-term AI treatment and subsequent AI resistance .
In vitro model systems have shown that __LTED__ may be accompanied by adaptive increases in ER expression and function and increased intracellular signalling , resulting in hypersensitivity to low oestrogen levels.39 and 40 In one model , MCF-7 cells deprived of oestrogen for 90 weeks passed through three distinct phases : quiescent , oestrogen-hypersensitive , and an apparently oestrogen-dependent stage.39 ER protein levels increased in the first two stages and this was accompanied by an increase in ER phosphorylation in the oestrogen-hypersensitive stage .
Beyond 50 weeks , addition of oestrogen had no apparent effect on cell growth .
However , exclusion of insulin from the culture medium inhibited the growth of these cells and restored oestrogen hypersensitivity suggesting that these cells were actually super-sensitised to residual oestrogen .
In addition , increased expression of HER2 and insulin-like growth factor receptor type I ( IGF-1R ) promote activation of MAPK and ER phosphorylation,39 and 40 suggesting cross-talk between the ER and signalling pathways at the time of relapse .
Such signalling mechanisms may activate ER in a similar way to that observed in cells with acquired resistance to tamoxifen .
Efficacy of SERMs
In addition to evaluating the efficacy of __AIs__ following progression on tamoxifen , retrospective questionnaire data from the __TARGET__ trial have demonstrated that tamoxifen appears to be an effective second-line therapy after anastrozole .
Of the 119 postmenopausal women with __ABC__ who were enrolled in the trial , 58 patients ( 49% ) gained clinical benefit , whilst 12 patients ( 10% ) had an objective response.27 Of the 16 patients who received tamoxifen following progression on anastrozole in the SAKK 21 / 95 sub-trial , eight gained clinical benefit ( 50% ) ,28 which is again a similar rate to that seen after cross-over in the __TARGET__ trial overall.27
Clinical benefit and objective response rates have not been reported for patients crossing from letrozole to tamoxifen , however survival data from a crossover analysis of a Phase III trial suggest that in this case , the reverse sequence may be more effective .
In this analysis 63% of patients crossing from first-line letrozole to tamoxifen died during second-line therapy or follow-up after second progression , compared with 47% for the reverse sequence .
Median overall survival from the date of crossover was 19 months ( 95% confidence limits ; 17 - 24 months ) for patients crossing to second-line tamoxifen , compared with 31 months ( 95% confidence limits ; 22 - 40 months ) for patients crossing to letrozole.7 There are no published studies assessing the efficacy of other SERMs in AI-resistant disease .
Efficacy of __AIs__
Steroidal __AIs__ have an androgen structure and compete with the aromatase substrate androstenedione .
They inactivate aromatase by irreversibly binding to its catalytic site , and additional aromatase must be produced before oestrogen biosynthesis can resume .
For this reason , steroidal __AIs__ are often called 'suicide inhibitors or aromatase inactivators .
This is in contrast to non-steroidal __AIs__ that reversibly interact with the cytochrome P450 moiety of aromatase and the interference with oestrogen biosynthesis is dependent on the continued presence of the non-steroidal agent.41 There are data to suggest that there is a lack of cross-resistance between steroidal __AIs__ and non-steroidal __AIs__ .
This may be due to the differences in mode of action between these agents or could be due additional endocrine effects associated with steroidal __AIs__ .
For instance , treatment with exemestane suppresses plasma sex hormone-binding globulin levels,42 an effect probably related to its androgenic activity .
Androgens have been shown to inhibit growth of breast cancer cell lines43 and have previously been used in the treatment of breast cancer .
Steroidal __AIs__ after non-steroidal __AIs__
Preliminary data suggest that steroidal __AIs__ may be an option in non-steroidal AI-resistant disease.44 , 45 , 46 and 47 In a Phase II , open-label , multinational trial , 24% of patients overall achieved clinical benefit with exemestane following the non-steroidal __AIs__ aminoglutethimide ( n=136 ) or anastrozole , letrozole or vorozole ( n=105 ) .47 For patients who received prior aminoglutethimide , the objective response and clinical benefit rates were 8 and 27% , respectively .
For those who had previously received anastrozole , letrozole or vorozole , the corresponding rates were 5 and 20% , respectively.47 In a further study assessing the activity of exemestane following aminoglutethimide failure ( n=78 ) , not , vert , similar26% of patients responded and not , vert , similar60% of patients had clinical benefit during second-line exemestane treatment.48 It is possible that this relatively high response rate could be explained by the more potent aromatisation associated with the exemestane compared with aminoglutethimide .
A retrospective analysis of 96 patients receiving exemestane ( as second- to greater than fourth-line therapy ; 89 / 96 had received prior non-steroidal __AIs__ ) reported that 37 / 96 ( 39% ) patients experienced clinical benefit with exemestane .46 Two studies ( n=112 and n=10 , respectively ) have reported responses in not , vert , similar20% and clinical benefit in not , vert , similar40 - 50% of patients receiving formestane following aminoglutethimide failure.49 and 50
Non-steroidal __AIs__ after steroidal __AIs__
Only one small study has reported on the activity of non-steroidal __AIs__ following steroidal AI failure .
This study assessed the activity of anastrozole in 21 patients following formestane failure and found that although no responses were observed with second-line anastrozole , 62% of patients experienced clinical benefit.51 The lack of cross-resistance between non-steroidal and steroidal __AIs__ and their optimum use in sequence requires further investigation in clinical trials .
Efficacy of high-dose oestrogens
Growth stimulation by oestrogen in vitro exhibits a bell-shaped curve ; thus high concentrations inhibit cell growth.52 and 53 Interestingly , this is also true for hypersensitised cells therefore these cells are inhibited by oestrogen concentrations that would stimulate growth of wild-type cells .
For these reasons , high-dose oestrogens have long since been used in the treatment of breast cancer .
The results of one small study suggested that some patients developing acquired resistance to __AIs__ were actually sensitised to oestrogen .
In this study 32 patients who had previously received a median of four prior endocrine regimens for breast cancer were treated with diethylstilboestrol.54 Ten patients experienced an objective response and two patients had stable disease >6 months , illustrating that patients resistant to __AIs__ and other endocrine treatments may benefit from subsequent high-dose oestrogen therapy .
Efficacy of fulvestrant
Preclinical data
Tamoxifen may induce oestrogen agonist effects in __LTED__ cells , in contrast , fulvestrant has no agonist activity and dramatically inhibits growth of __LTED__ MCF-7 breast cancer cells.39 and 40 In vivo , fulvestrant also inhibits the growth of long-term letrozole-treated MCF-7 tumour xenografts55 suggesting it could be effective following resistance to __AIs__ .
Clinical data
Preliminary results from an ongoing Phase II SAKK trial showed that fulvestrant treatment may produce clinical benefit in patients who have progressed with both tamoxifen and an AI.56 Of the first 32 evaluable patients , 11 patients ( 34% ) had clinical benefit with fulvestrant .
The final analysis for patients included in Stratum A ( patients who pro__ABC__ progressing after treatment with tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors : update of a phase II SAKK trial , Breast Cancer Res Treat 88 ( 2004 ) ( Suppl. 1 ) , p. S236 abs 6048.57 Of the 67 evaluable patients , 19 ( 28% ) had clinical benefit with fulvestrant .
Recruitment to Stratum B ( patients who did not respond to AI treatment or showed stable disease of <24 weeks ) is ongoing.57 A similar clinical benefit rate was observed in a two-stage Phase II trial of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group.58 Of the 77 patients who had progressed on an AI and were included in the analysis , 25 patients ( 33% ) had clinical benefit with fulvestrant.58
The use of fulvestrant in a compassionate-use programme has also yielded data on the efficacy of fulvestrant in patients who have progressed after prior endocrine therapy , often including both tamoxifen and __AIs__ .59 , 60 and 61 For example , the clinical benefit rate was 52% in one centre where patients received fulvestrant as second- ( n=16 ) , third- ( n=15 ) , fourth- ( n=8 ) or fifth- ( n=5 ) line hormonal therapy for advanced disease.60 Prior endocrine therapies included tamoxifen , non-steroidal __AIs__ and formestane .
In a second centre , 50 of the 88 patients ( 56% ) who had previously received a non-steroidal AI for advanced disease had stable disease or partial response with fulvestrant treatment.61 In general , better responses appeared to be observed when fulvestrant was used earlier in the treatment sequence.59 and 60
The use of fulvestrant earlier in the treatment sequence is further supported by a small series of 14 postmenopausal patients from the Royal Marsden and Christie Hospitals .
Patients enrolled had ER-positive locally recurrent advanced or metastatic disease , and were treated with fulvestrant following progression on a non-steroidal AI .
Of the 14 patients enrolled , three gained clinical benefit ( 21% ) , all of whom had received a non-steroidal AI for 6 - 14 months .
No responses were seen in patients who had received two or more endocrine therapies ( n=6 ) or had received a non-steroidal AI for less than 6 months for advanced disease ( n=2 ) , or in those who had received adjuvant therapy for less than 2 years ( n=1 ) .
Median overall survival of 13.8 months has been reported in a retrospective analysis of data from 23 patients who received fulvestrant at three centres in Rio de Janeiro as part of an expanded access programme.62 The median number of previous endocrine therapies was two and all patients had previously received tamoxifen and an AI .
Furthermore , three patients ( 13% ) are continuing to benefit from fulvestrant treatment after 1.5 years , suggesting there is a subgroup of patients who may experience prolonged responses with fulvestrant.62
Conclusions
There is a need for endocrine agents that are effective following tamoxifen / AI failure to maintain disease control , delay the use of cytotoxic chemotherapy and help maintain patient quality of life .
Fulvestrant is a new type of ER antagonist with a novel mode of action , which limits the possibility of cross-resistance with other frequently used endocrine therapies .
Unlike tamoxifen and other SERMs , fulvestrant has no oestrogen agonist effects and is effective in tamoxifen-resistant disease .
Both non-steroidal and steroidal __AIs__ are also effective in tamoxifen-resistant disease , however the __AIs__ are now replacing tamoxifen as first-line advanced and adjuvant therapies , and thus other options following tamoxifen failure are required .
This change in the sequencing of endocrine therapies has resulted in a need to explore the optimal endocrine sequence after AI failure .
There is a lack of data comparing the effectiveness of current endocrine agents following AI failure , however , there is preliminary evidence that new endocrine treatments such as fulvestrant may be effective as well as older agents such as tamoxifen .
There is also evidence of a lack of cross-resistance between non-steroidal and steroidal __AIs__ , resulting in the potential use of steroidal __AIs__ following non-steroidal AI failure and vice versa .
Future directions
Although fulvestrant and the __AIs__ are effective in tamoxifen-resistant disease , there is a lack of robust clinical data for the most effective sequence of agents following AI failure .
Comparisons of fulvestrant and exemestane in this setting are of great interest .
With the increasing use of non-steroidal __AIs__ early in the treatment sequence , the need to define the optimum sequence following treatment with these agents is mounting .
A clinical trial programme is underway to help identify the most appropriate agents following non-steroidal AI failure in postmenopausal patients with __ABC__ .
For example , the __EFECT__ aims to compare fulvestrant with exemestane following non-steroidal AI failure ; The __EFECT__ trial aims to compare fulvestrant with exemestane , in addition to fulvestrant in combination with anastrozole following non-steroidal AI failure , and the __EFECT__ , aims to compare fulvestrant in combination with anastrozole with anastrozole alone in patients receiving prior adjuvant treatment ( tamoxifen or non-steroidal __AIs__ ) .
All three trials are now recruiting .
Only when results from these trials are available can a rational decision be made about treatment of continuing relapse after non-steroidal AI failure .
