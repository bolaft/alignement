1. Introduction
In breast cancer , the general approach to evaluation has become formalised as triple assessment , involving clinical examination , imaging ( usually mammography and / or ultrasound ) and pathology ( core biopsy and / or fine needle aspiration ) .
In breast cancer screening , although mammography remains the gold standard for breast imaging , the sensitivity varies from 62.9% to 87%.1 The lack of sensitivity is in part due to increased breast density in younger women and in women taking hormone replacement therapy obscuring potential breast cancers. A further limitation of conventional screening is the faster rate of tumour growth resulting in higher rates of interval cancers in younger women. Together this has prompted the search for alternative approaches for the diagnosis of breast cancer .
The intraductal approach comprising nipple aspiration , ductal lavage and duct endoscopy is a minimally invasive technique which allows direct access to the ductal system from which the majority of breast cancers arise. This approach could provide an alternative or adjunct to current diagnostic techniques particularly in younger women where the sensitivity of mammography is reduced .
Studies using cytological analysis of __NAF__ have found that atypical hyperplasia of breast ductal epithelium is associated with an increased risk of subsequent development of breast cancer. and 10 M.R.

The emerging field of proteomics allows the identification of many proteins in a cell or biological fluid in a single experiment unlike older biochemical techniques which identify single proteins .
Recent advances in molecular technologies have enabled rapid , protein biomarker identification from small volumes of __NAF__ using surface-enhanced laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry ( SELDI-TOF / MS ) .
SELDI-TOF / MS combines on-array separation of complex protein mixtures via retention coupled directly with mass spectrometry and has the advantage that its high sample throughput allows the generation of sufficient data to perform strong statistical tests .
The purpose of this study was to use SELDI-TOF / MS to compare the __NAF__ proteome from women with unilateral breast cancer and healthy women to discover differences that might be exploited in a diagnostic or screening test .
2. Materials and methods
The study protocol was approved by the Royal Marsden Hospital Committee for Clinical Research and the Research Ethics Committee .
2.1. Collection and SELDI-TOF / MS analysis of __NAF__
Paired __NAF__ samples were obtained from the cancer ( affected ) and contralateral ( unaffected ) breast from 21 women recently diagnosed with unilateral invasive breast cancer and undergoing primary surgery at the Royal Marsden Hospital .
__NAF__ samples were obtained from a further 44 healthy at risk women attending the Royal Marsden Hospital for breast screening due to a family history of breast cancer .
Healthy at risk women were defined by NICE guidelines ( ) .
For both groups , the criteria for exclusion were previous breast surgery , pregnancy , breast feeding within the last 12 months , breast implants , active infection of the breast or allergy to lidocaine .
For the healthy at risk women , the criteria for exclusion were an abnormal mammogram or clinical examination at the time of __NAF__ collection .
The details of patient characteristics are provided in Table 1. The volume of nipple fluid collected ranged from 0 to >100 µl , with an average of 16 µl per breast .
The number of productive ducts was 1 - 3 per breast and where __NAF__ was collected from more than one duct , it was pooled .
For each patient , the collected __NAF__ was stored separately from the cancer-bearing and contralateral uninvolved breasts .
Samples were stored for up to 12 months and underwent a maximum of three freeze - thaw cycles .
The process of collection and storage of __NAF__ , preparation of the IMAC30 and CM10 ( Ciphergen , Freemont , USA ) ProteinChip arrays and the Ciphergen SELDI-TOF / MS analysis have been described previously.11 As recommended,12 a strict protocol for the handling , storage and analysis of __NAF__ was adhered to .
2.2. Data analysis
The spectra from all samples were collated and normalised .
Consistent peak clusters were generated using the Biomarker Wizard ProteinChip software ( Ciphergen ) .
The first pass used a signal-to-noise ratio set to 5 with a threshold of 20% .
The second pass used a signal-to-noise ratio of 2 and included peaks within 0.3% of the mass of the peaks found in the first pass .
Data below 3000 Da were excluded to avoid matrix noise .
A majority of peaks fell within this range .
A cluster graph was generated where each peak intensity was plotted against m / z for the three sample groups ( cancer , contralateral and healthy ) .
Comparisons between groups were made using the Mann - Whitney U-test .
A P-value of <0.05 for a given peak indicated that this peak was differentially expressed .
3. Results
Paired __NAF__ samples were collected from 21 women with breast cancer .
Of the 44 healthy at risk women , bilateral __NAF__ samples were obtained from 27 and unilateral samples from 17 women .
The two groups were well matched for age and menopausal status , but a higher percentage of women in the healthy group had a family history of breast cancer ( 88% versus 43% ) .
A comparison of the proteomic profiles by SELDI-TOF / MS from the cancer-bearing and contralateral breasts from the women with breast cancer revealed no peaks with P-values less than 0.05 on the CM10 surface .
On the IMAC30 surface , there was one apparent peak at a mass of 4306 Da ( P < 0.05 ) but on examination of the spectra this was seen as an amalgamation of several peaks rather than a peak in its own right ( data not shown ) .
A comparison of __NAF__ from the cancer-bearing breast and from healthy patients revealed nine statistically significant peaks on the CM10 surface .
Of these , the peaks at 3471 Da , 3511 Da , 4151 Da , 4586 Da , 4646 Da and 4698 Da were single peaks .
On close inspection putative peaks at 15,895 Da , 19,263 Da and 23,174 Da comprised multiple peaks and were therefore not included in this analysis .
On the IMAC30 array , four statistically significant peaks were identified with P-values <0.05 .
Of these , three well discriminated peaks were seen at 3501 Da , 3627 Da and 4147 Da , whereas the peak at 23,232 Da was again a composite and hence was excluded .
Interestingly , the peaks at 4151 Da on the CM10 array and 4147 Da on the IMAC30 array were within 0.3% of each other and are likely to be the same protein .
Next , a comparison was made between __NAF__ from the contralateral breast of women with cancer and __NAF__ from healthy patients .
On the CM10 array there were seven statistically significant peaks .
The peaks at 3471 Da , 3869 Da , 4151 Da , 4646 Da and 14,720 Da were single peaks .
The peaks at 19,263 and 23,174 Da were multiple peaks and hence excluded from further analysis .
Three out of the five significant single peaks in the healthy versus contralateral group were also significant in the cancer versus healthy group ; two peaks at 3869 Da and 14,720 Da were not found to be significant in the cancer versus healthy group .
Given the homogeneity between the cancer-affected and the contralateral breast , a large amount of overlap would be expected and indeed was observed in this analysis .
On the IMAC30 array there were seven statistically significant peaks .
The peaks at 3501 Da , 3627 Da , 4147 Da , 4376 Da and 5890 Da were single peaks , while the peaks at 23,232 Da and 25,784 Da were groups of peaks and were excluded .
Three of the significant single peaks in the healthy versus contralateral group were also present in the cancer versus healthy group ; two peaks at 4646 and 5890 Da were not found to be significant in the cancer versus healthy group .
4. Discussion
Current diagnostic tools of breast cancer have limitations even when used in combination .
The advent of new technologies , which allow the rapid identification of secreted proteins in readily accessible body fluids , may provide an alternative to the current practice .
The intraductal approach , and in particular the collection of __NAF__ , is a simple , non-invasive method which allows access to fluid from the breast ductal system .
The advantage of using SELDI-TOF / MS to analyse these samples is that this high throughput technology allows statistical verification of data and good reproducibility once , as is the case here , sample preparation and handling is standardised .
This study compared __NAF__ from 21 women with unilateral breast cancer and 44 healthy women .
Examination of the paired samples from the 21 women with breast cancer revealed no statistically significant differences between the cancer-bearing breast and the contralateral non-cancerous breast .
Similar findings have been reported previously when paired __NAF__ samples from 12 and 23 women , respectively , with unilateral breast cancer were examined .
These studies and the study reported here noted that in women with unilateral breast cancer , there was a high degree of homology between breasts in the same woman .
Consequently , one explanation for the inability of these studies to identify differences between the cancer-bearing and non-cancerous breast is due to the heterogeneity between patients .
An alternative explanation is that the effect of breast cancer on __NAF__ composition is systemic .
To address this , __NAF__ obtained from women with breast cancer was compared to that obtained from healthy women .
The comparison between __NAF__ from the cancer-bearing breast and the breasts of healthy women revealed a number of statistically significant peaks .
Interestingly , in the study by Pawlik et al.,14 __NAF__ from five healthy volunteers was compared to the __NAF__ collected from the 23 women with breast cancer using WCX2 and IMAC3 arrays .
Seventeen peaks were statistically significant between the __NAF__ from the cancer-bearing breasts and the breasts of healthy volunteers and three statistically significant peaks were found when the contralateral non-cancerous breast was compared to the breasts of healthy volunteers .
It is also notable that in a study comparing pathological nipple discharge in 114 women ( 27 with breast cancer and 87 benign ) , three proteins were found to be associated with breast cancer.15 More recently,16 a study has progressed to both validation and protein identification of proteins in __NAF__ .
In this study __NAF__ from 5 women with cancer and 5 healthy women was used to find three discriminatory peaks .
The peaks were validated using ductal lavage specimens and then identified as human neutrophil peptide 1 - 3 by database searching .
Identification was confirmed using monoclonal antibodies and a prospective study is now in progress to measure the predictive value of these proteins.16 However , there is no overlap between the proteins found in these two studies or those found in the current study .
The most likely explanation for this lack of overlap is that different protocols were used in each study .
In particular are the differences in the arrays surfaces which select for different classes of proteins , instrument settings and bioinformatic tools that were employed.17 However , it is also important to consider other shortcomings in current proteomic-based technologies .
As discussed by Diamandis,17 the failure to identify tumour makers in the circulation has raised concern as to the sensitivity of SELDI-TOF / MS to detect low abundance proteins and that proteins which have been identified may represent acute phase reactants or epiphenomena of tumour presence rather than the products of the tumour cells themselves .
It is as a result of such concerns that attention in the breast cancer community has focussed on the analysis of __NAF__ as this involves direct sampling of the breast microenvironment so that any tumour-associated components would be present at a higher concentration compared to serum .
Despite this advantage , we demonstrate here the limitation of this approach for the diagnosis or screening of women with breast cancer due to the homology of the __NAF__ proteomic profiles between the cancer-bearing and contralateral breast .
This lack of difference may result from the inherent heterogeneity between patients and problems in sensitivity associated with SELDI-TOF / MS .
In addition , __NAF__ is only collected from a subset of the ducts in the breast , and tumour-bearing ducts may be less likely to yield __NAF__ due to physical obstruction of the lumen and duct collapse.18 However , as this study did reveal proteins whose abundance was significantly different between the cancer-bearing breast and healthy women and also between the contralateral non-cancerous breast of women with breast cancer and healthy women , an alternative explanation is that __NAF__ proteomic profiling reveals a systemic change in women with breast cancer .
In conclusion , the study presented here is the largest to date to compare __NAF__ from women with breast cancer and healthy women .
The findings and our identification of unique peaks add to the growing body of literature on this subject and offer some insight into __NAF__ as a representation of the breast microenvironment .
Together these data demonstrate the limitations to using the intraductal approach in the diagnosis or screening of women with breast cancer , particularly as the identification of the cancer-bearing breast may be impossible using conventional imaging techniques .
However , as __NAF__ proteomic profiling did distinguish between women with and without breast cancer , this study indicates the value of exploring the use of __NAF__ proteomic profiling as a risk assessment tool and / or to monitor the course of disease and response to treatment .
Consequently future work should focus on the predictive value of validated proteins , singly and groups , within new sample sets and then to employ complementary techniques for biomarker identification .
This will allow the generation of autologous immuno-based assays that could be used for the rapid analysis of specific proteins in large sample groups and ultimately to follow women prospectively to assess the predictive value of these biomarkers .
